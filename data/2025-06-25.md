### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自治代理如何通过通信信号协调活动并提升集体效率，展示了代理如何通过学习形成共享行为系统（文化）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自治代理如何通过通信信号自组织形成文化，并研究不同通信策略对其合作和适应性的影响。

Method: 使用NEC-DAC系统，每个代理配备神经网络进行决策，分析不同社会结构（如权威层级）对文化形成的影响。

Result: 研究发现合作文化显著影响部落表现，信号不仅促进文化涌现，还支持跨代传播。

Conclusion: 通信信号和文化形成对代理集体效率至关重要，神经网络内的行为协调和信号传递具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在战略随机化中的表现，提出了一种基于田忌赛马的零和游戏来评估LLMs的随机化决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略随机化在游戏理论中很重要，但在LLMs中研究不足。现有研究常混淆随机化的认知决策与机械生成随机性，导致评估不完整。

Method: 设计了一个零和游戏，其纳什均衡对应最大熵策略，通过多轮比赛评估五种LLMs在不同提示风格下的表现。

Result: 较弱模型始终确定性行为，较强模型在明确提示下增加随机化；面对弱模型时，强模型采用确定性策略，面对同类时趋向均衡。

Conclusion: LLMs的战略推理能力存在显著差异，凸显了抽象推理和自适应学习的改进空间。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出大型推理模型（LRMs）在特定复杂度阈值后性能崩溃，但批评者认为这是实验设计限制而非认知边界，并通过工具增强模型展示了性能逆转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LRMs性能崩溃的根本原因，挑战其认知限制的结论，强调实验设计的局限性。

Method: 通过工具增强模型（如o4-mini和GPT-4o）重新测试，展示其在复杂任务中的表现。

Result: 工具增强模型能解决原本被认为不可能的任务，甚至超越原复杂度阈值。

Conclusion: LRMs的性能崩溃源于工具限制而非推理能力不足，工具支持能显著提升其表现。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN应用于南非次国家级产量预测，与传统ML模型表现相当，但更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN在小到中型表格数据中的潜力，特别是在农业产量预测任务中的应用。

Method: 使用10天时间序列的EO和天气数据，按月聚合，通过TabPFN预测产量，并与6种ML模型和3种基线模型对比。

Result: TabPFN与ML模型精度相当，但调优更快且无需复杂特征工程。

Conclusion: TabPFN因其高效性和易用性，更适合实际产量预测应用。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [5] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在2D解谜游戏《Baba is You》中的表现，发现尽管LLM在语言任务上表现良好，但在动态规则推理方面仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在结合语言能力和推理能力的游戏中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估了六种LLM在不同提示类型下的表现，并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行了微调。

Result: 大型模型（如GPT-4o）表现较好，但小型未调整模型难以理解游戏机制；微调提升了分析能力，但对解决方案生成帮助有限。

Conclusion: 即使是最先进的LLM，动态规则推理仍具挑战性，游戏可作为测试LLM推理能力的有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [6] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT-4o的新框架GITes，用于提升情绪支持效果，并通过实验验证了其在多项指标上的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统仅基于用户当前情绪和情境生成回应，导致干预效果肤浅，无法满足深层情感需求。

Method: 研究整合《薄伽梵歌》的精神智慧与GPT-4o，构建GITes数据集，并引入Spiritual Insight指标，通过LLM作为评审框架进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct在多项指标上显著提升，如ROUGE（122.71%）、Spiritual Insight（15.92%）等。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合精神智慧的AI系统在提升用户满意度和支持效果方面潜力巨大，但需进一步在真实患者群体中验证。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [7] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率代理的AI系统框架，通过结构化竞争和信念修正实现进化，证明了真理作为进化吸引子的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是建立一个数学上严格的AI系统框架，通过竞争和信念修正实现代理的进化，并验证真理的可进化性。

Method: 方法结合了贝叶斯推理、测度理论和群体动力学，代理通过竞争和信念调整进化，评级基于与真理的对齐程度。

Result: 结果表明系统能够实现代理的收敛性、鲁棒性和进化稳定性，真理成为系统的进化吸引子。

Conclusion: 结论是这种框架能够通过对抗性认知压力产生可验证知识，为自调节群体AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多粒度颗粒球（GBGC）的高效自适应图粗化方法，显著提升了粗化效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图粗化方法主要基于谱保持视角，忽略了图的多粒度特性，导致粗化结果不理想。

Method: GBGC通过自适应颗粒球图细化机制，将原始图从粗到细划分为不同大小的颗粒球，并以这些颗粒球为超节点构建粗化图。

Result: GBGC的处理速度比其他方法快数十至数百倍，且准确性几乎始终高于原始图。

Conclusion: GBGC因其良好的鲁棒性和泛化性，有望成为标准的图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1是一个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的推荐框架，通过两阶段训练（SFT和GRPO）优化推荐准确性、多样性和业务目标，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统中的“过滤气泡”、外部知识利用不足以及模型优化与业务政策迭代脱节的问题。

Method: 1. 将用户数据和项目属性转化为LLM可理解的自然语言提示；2. 两阶段训练：SFT和GRPO（结合CoT机制）。

Result: 在真实数据集上显著提升准确性、多样性和新颖性，有效缓解过滤气泡效应。

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1为复杂业务目标下的推荐模型与政策优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将情绪检测集成到日历应用中，通过生物特征和行为两种方法提升用户体验，发现行为方法更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过情绪识别技术提升人机交互的个性化和适应性，改善用户的生产力和参与度。

Method: 采用生物特征（基于心率的LSTM和GRU神经网络）和行为（基于用户交互的机器学习模型）两种方法检测情绪。

Result: 行为方法在鼠标交互中准确率达90%，GRU在生物特征方法中表现优于LSTM（效价预测准确率84.38%）。

Conclusion: 行为方法在情绪检测中更具一致性和准确性，尤其适用于日历应用的动态响应。

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

*Liang Zeng,Yongcong Li,Yuzhen Xiao,Changshi Li,Chris Yuhao Liu,Rui Yan,Tianwen Wei,Jujie He,Xuchen Song,Yang Liu,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化的数据整理流程，用于扩展软件工程（SWE）数据集的规模和多样性，并展示了数据规模对模型性能的持续提升作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程领域的数据整理过程耗时且依赖人工标注，现有数据集规模有限，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用增量式自动化数据整理流程，从GitHub收集10,169个Python任务实例，并配备运行时环境用于单元测试验证。

Result: Skywork-SWE模型在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中达到38.0% pass@1准确率，结合测试时扩展技术后提升至47.0%。

Conclusion: 自动化数据整理流程显著提升了数据集规模和多样性，模型性能随数据规模持续提升，未出现饱和现象。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI辅导系统中高质量教师反馈数据生成的高成本和时间消耗问题。

Method: 提出FEAT框架，构建三种数据集（DM、DG、DA），结合人工和LLM生成反馈。

Result: 实验表明，在DG中加入少量DM（5-10%）比单独使用100% DM表现更优。

Conclusion: FEAT框架在保证成本效益的同时，显著提升了反馈生成的质量。

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于搜索的游戏关卡修复方法，结合进化算法和多样性质量算法，修复由机器学习生成的风格一致但常存在问题的关卡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决游戏关卡设计中生成的关卡功能不完整或不可行的问题，同时限制修复时的修改次数。

Method: 采用基于搜索的方法，特别是进化和多样性质量算法，修复由PCGML生成的关卡。

Result: 该方法在修复机器学习生成的关卡上表现出色，展示了混合PCG方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 结合PCGML生成和搜索修复的混合方法在游戏关卡设计中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG是一种新型对话系统框架，通过动态意图转移图和双检索机制，显著提升多轮客服对话的上下文连贯性和目标导向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以同时保持上下文连贯和目标导向的问题。

Method: 构建动态意图转移图，结合意图图遍历和语义搜索的双检索机制。

Result: 在自动指标和LLM评估中显著优于传统方法，如BLEU提升11%，响应质量提升58%。

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG通过意图结构和语义检索的协同效应，有效解决了知识密集型多轮对话的挑战。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

*Yazhou Zhang,Chunwang Zou,Bo Wang,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Commander-GPT是一个基于军事指挥理论的多模块决策路由框架，通过协调多个专用LLM代理来提升多模态讽刺理解能力，实验结果显示其性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多模态讽刺理解任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的框架来整合多个LLM的专长。

Method: 提出Commander-GPT框架，通过三种集中式指挥官协调多个专用LLM代理（如上下文建模、情感分析等），并整合其输出进行最终判断。

Result: 在MMSD和MMSD 2.0基准测试中，F1分数分别比现有基线平均提高了4.4%和11.7%。

Conclusion: Commander-GPT通过模块化设计和多代理协作，显著提升了多模态讽刺理解的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

(LJ) across four benchmarks, highlighting the framework's robustness and
effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.

*Yan Jiang,Hao Zhou,LiZhong GU,Ai Han,TianLong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NaviAgent是一种基于图导航的双层规划架构，通过多路径决策器和图编码导航器，显著提升复杂工具链的调用成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态知识和单一执行路径，导致错误恢复能力差和搜索空间爆炸，无法有效管理复杂异构工具链。

Method: NaviAgent采用双层规划架构：多路径决策器动态选择最优动作，图编码导航器构建工具依赖异构图并集成启发式搜索策略。

Result: 实验表明，NaviAgent在所有基础模型和任务复杂度下均表现最佳，任务成功率平均提升13.5%-19.0%，执行步骤接近最优基线。

Conclusion: NaviAgent通过动态规划和图导航显著提升了工具链调用的鲁棒性和效率，尤其适用于复杂任务和大规模模型。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

*Carlo Romeo,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的动态难度调整方法（NTRL），用于自动化设计《龙与地下城》的战斗遭遇，提升战斗策略性和难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决《龙与地下城》中战斗遭遇设计的复杂性，避免手动调整对叙事流的干扰。

Method: 将问题建模为上下文多臂老虎机，基于实时队伍属性生成战斗遭遇。

Result: NTRL显著延长战斗时间（+200%），增加队伍伤害（-16.67%生命值），提升玩家死亡次数但保持低团灭率，同时保证高胜率（70%）。

Conclusion: NTRL在提升战斗策略深度和难度的同时，保持了游戏公平性，表现优于人工设计的遭遇。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号推理（ASP）与黑盒机器学习的方法，通过FOLD-R++算法生成可解释规则，提升模型性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗）中，高性能机器学习模型往往缺乏可解释性，而符号方法虽可解释但预测能力不足。

Method: 采用混合方法，将FOLD-R++算法生成的ASP规则与黑盒ML分类器结合，选择性修正不确定预测并提供解释。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集上实验显示，准确率和F1分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合符号推理与机器学习可在不牺牲准确性的前提下提高模型可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: TAPAS是一个多智能体框架，结合LLM和符号规划，无需手动定义环境模型即可解决复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务时避免手动定义环境模型的需求，提高适应性和灵活性。

Method: 使用基于LLM的智能体协作生成和调整领域模型、初始状态和目标规范，通过工具调用机制实现动态适应。

Result: 在基准规划领域和VirtualHome模拟环境中表现出色。

Conclusion: TAPAS通过动态生成和调整模型，展示了无需手动干预的高效任务解决能力。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ChordPrompt的框架，通过跨模态提示和领域自适应文本提示，解决了现有提示学习方法在多领域任务增量学习中的局限性，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在增量学习场景中难以保持跨领域性能，现有提示学习方法主要关注类增量学习，且缺乏跨模态信息交换。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，结合视觉和文本提示的跨模态交互，并采用领域自适应文本提示选择策略。

Result: 在多领域增量学习基准测试中，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt通过跨模态和领域自适应的提示设计，有效提升了视觉语言模型在多领域增量学习中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

### [25] [Identifying Macro Causal Effects in C-DMGs over DMGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19650)
*Simon Ferreira,Charles K. Assaad*

TL;DR: 本文证明了在DMGs上的C-DMGs中，do-calculus无条件地适用于识别宏观因果效应，并扩展了非可识别性的图形标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中高维数据的复杂性使得完全指定ADMG不可行，而部分指定的因果表示（如C-DMGs）更具实用性。此外，循环因果动态在结构层面普遍存在，需要更通用的模型（如ioSCMs和DMGs）。

Method: 通过引入ioSCMs和DMGs，扩展了C-DMGs的应用范围，并分析了do-calculus在DMGs上的C-DMGs中的适用性。

Result: 证明了do-calculus在DMGs上的C-DMGs中无条件地适用于识别宏观因果效应，并扩展了非可识别性的图形标准。

Conclusion: 研究为处理高维和循环因果系统提供了更通用的工具，扩展了因果推断的理论基础。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类和动物快速适应新环境的能力，探索其背后的情景记忆机制，并通过Transformer模型模拟这一过程。

Method: 使用Transformer模型在规划任务中进行上下文强化学习，分析其学习算法和表征学习机制。

Result: 模型的学习策略不同于传统模型，依赖于缓存中间计算，且表征学习与大脑海马-内嗅皮层系统的计算相似。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种机制假说，解释了人工和自然环境中上下文学习的快速适应性，并表明记忆可作为计算资源支持灵活行为。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种集成估计优化（IEO）框架，通过联合调整预测模型并直接优化维护结果，减少预测误差对维护决策的影响，相比传统ETO框架，平均维护后悔减少22%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习在预测性维护（PdM）中的应用日益增多，但模型误设带来的不确定性限制了工业界的广泛采用。研究旨在解决预测准确性是否必然改善维护决策，以及如何减轻预测误差对决策的影响。

Method: 提出IEO框架，结合预测模型调整与维护结果直接优化，开发了适用于小样本数据的随机扰动梯度下降算法。

Result: 实证研究表明，IEO框架比传统ETO框架平均减少22%的维护后悔，显著提升了决策质量。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过将预测模型训练与维护目标对齐，提高了模型误设下的鲁棒性和决策质量，为不确定环境中的可靠维护规划提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估AI代理在给定不同代码起点时实现科学想法的基准测试，AutoExperiment填补了这一空白。

Method: 提供研究论文、部分代码被屏蔽的代码库和实验命令，要求代理生成缺失代码并在沙盒环境中运行实验。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment为评估AI驱动科学实验进展提供了新基准，突出了长时程代码生成和自主实验执行的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous

### [30] [Automatic Prompt Optimization for Knowledge Graph Construction: Insights from an Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19773)
*Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Niharika S. D'Souza,Faisal Chowdhury,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动提示优化在知识图谱三元组抽取任务中的应用，通过实验评估不同设置，发现自动优化的提示能生成接近人工设计的提示，并在复杂模式和长文本中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱（KG）构建中的三元组抽取是关键任务，但为大型语言模型（LLM）手工设计提示耗时且脆弱。自动提示优化技术有望解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实验评估不同设置（如提示策略、LLM选择、模式复杂度、文本长度等），比较三种自动提示优化工具（DSPy、APE、TextGrad）在两个数据集（SynthIE、REBEL）上的表现。

Result: 自动提示优化生成的提示接近人工设计，且在模式复杂性和文本长度增加时表现更优。

Conclusion: 自动提示优化技术能有效提升三元组抽取任务的效果，尤其在复杂场景下。

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

*Teng Wang,Hailei Gong,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于策略引导的强化学习方法（SAGE），通过专家策略和新型奖励机制提升查询改写的效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前查询改写方法需要大量监督数据或强化学习探索效率低，限制了密集检索的性能提升。

Method: 引入策略自适应生成引擎（SAGE），结合专家策略和两种新型奖励机制（SCS和CRS），优化查询改写过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最优NDCG@10结果，同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合精细奖励机制，为信息检索系统提供了可扩展、高效且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，现有方法难以准确重建奖励信号，导致探索效率低下。SimBelief旨在通过任务信念相似性解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SimBelief框架，利用潜在任务信念度量学习相似任务的共同结构，并将其与特定任务信念结合，以快速识别和适应任务。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的MuJoCo和panda-gym任务中，SimBelief优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: SimBelief通过任务信念相似性有效提升了元强化学习在稀疏奖励环境中的性能。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

TL;DR: KnowRL通过将基于知识验证的事实性奖励整合到强化学习训练中，减少慢思考模型中的幻觉问题，同时保持其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决慢思考模型因无法准确识别知识边界而导致的严重幻觉问题，同时强化学习的事实监督不足加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出KnowRL方法，通过知识验证生成事实性奖励，指导模型进行基于事实的慢思考，并识别知识边界。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上，KnowRL有效减少了幻觉问题，同时保持了模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL通过事实性奖励显著降低了慢思考模型的幻觉，同时不损害其推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员通常不了解或不遵守数据可视化原则，导致图表中的信息不准确或不完整。本研究旨在利用VLMs自动识别这些问题。

Method: 使用五种开源VLMs和五种提示策略，通过一组基于数据可视化指南的问题来评估VLMs的适用性。

Result: VLMs在分析图表类型、3D效果、轴标签等方面表现良好，但在图像质量和刻度标记方面表现不佳。Qwen2.5VL和总结提示策略效果最佳。

Conclusion: VLMs可用于自动识别图表中的潜在问题，如缺失轴标签或图例，未来可扩展至更多数据可视化领域。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于逆强化学习（IRL）的Temporal-IRL模型，用于预测港口拥堵，通过分析船舶行为和停泊时间优化供应链管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口拥堵预测对全球供应链的可靠性至关重要，准确的预测可以优化运输计划、减少延误和成本，并提升供应链韧性。

Method: 通过分析历史AIS数据重建泊位调度，利用逆强化学习（IRL）确定奖励函数，开发了Temporal-IRL模型来预测船舶序列和停泊时间。

Result: 模型在纽约/新泽西港的Maher Terminal数据上训练和测试，取得了显著优异的预测结果。

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL模型能有效预测港口拥堵，为供应链管理提供了实用的工具。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

TL;DR: JoyAgents-R1 提出了一种多智能体强化学习（MARL）的联合进化方法，通过GRPO优化异构智能体的训练，提升决策和记忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构智能体联合进化中的协作低效和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 采用GRPO进行联合训练，结合蒙特卡洛采样和边际效益驱动的选择策略，优化智能体模型更新和记忆进化。

Result: 在通用和特定领域场景中，JoyAgents-R1 性能媲美更大规模LLM，同时基于较小开源模型实现。

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1 提供了一种高效稳定的MARL训练框架，适用于复杂异构任务。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

TL;DR: HI-SQL提出了一种基于历史查询日志的提示生成机制，用于改进Text-to-SQL生成，显著提高了复杂查询的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法在处理多表连接和嵌套条件等复杂查询时存在高计算成本、延迟和错误传播问题。

Method: HI-SQL通过分析历史查询日志生成上下文提示，指导SQL生成，避免了多步流程的开销。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准数据集上显著提高了LLM生成查询的准确性，同时降低了延迟。

Conclusion: HI-SQL为增强Text-to-SQL系统提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLoRA通过剪枝选择性移除LoRA层，提升模型安全性同时保持性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLMs可能损害安全对齐，现有方法难以平衡安全与性能。

Method: 提出SPLoRA和E-DIEM指标，通过剪枝优化安全对齐。

Result: SPLoRA显著降低安全风险，保持或提升性能，减少推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是高效、可扩展的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: Chain-of-Experts (CoE) 是一种新的 Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 架构，通过层内专家顺序通信提升模型表现和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 MoE 模型中专家独立并行操作，缺乏动态交互，限制了模型的表示能力。CoE 旨在通过迭代专家选择和通信解决这一问题。

Method: CoE 在每层内引入顺序专家链，每个迭代步骤配备专用路由器，支持动态专家选择和重新评估。

Result: 在固定计算量下，CoE 在数学推理任务中将验证损失从 1.20 降至 1.12，并减少内存使用 17.6-42%。

Conclusion: CoE 通过迭代残差结构和动态路由增强了专家专业化，提供了新的扩展维度（深度迭代），优于传统宽度/深度扩展。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

Conclusion: 该模型为注塑过程的智能质量控制提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Conclusion: HOLA证明了其在边缘设备上的高效性和生产就绪性。

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Motivation: 桥梁作为关键基础设施，其退化问题日益严重，需要可靠的交通监测以评估剩余使用寿命。传统方法存在隐私和光照限制，非视觉方法则缺乏灵活性。

Method: 结合计算机视觉辅助生成高分辨率数据集，利用图神经网络捕捉传感器数据的空间结构和相互依赖，实现自动化监测。

Result: 在真实案例中，模型对轻型车辆和重型车辆的分类准确率分别达到99%和94%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过知识迁移实现了与视觉系统相当的精度，且减少了人工干预，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

*Shashank Yadav,Vignesh Subbian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出可学习掩码框架作为动态时间序列预测的替代方法，以解决传统解释性算法在关键护理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键护理中，深度学习的可解释性对患者生存至关重要，但传统方法难以应对动态预测任务中的时间变化依赖性和时间平滑性。

Method: 系统分析传统方法的失败模式，并提出可学习掩码框架，结合时间连续性和标签一致性约束。

Result: 可学习掩码方法在动态时间序列预测中提供更可靠和一致的解释。

Conclusion: 可学习掩码框架适用于关键护理等需要动态预测的领域。

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，旨在提升健康数据中的因果公平性，生成的数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据不到10%，并显著减少了敏感属性的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注反事实公平性，且多应用于金融和法律领域，而健康领域缺乏针对因果公平性的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于LLM增强的合成数据生成方法，利用真实世界表格健康数据，确保因果结构的保留。

Result: 生成的数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据不到10%，且使用合成数据训练的预测器在敏感属性上的偏见减少了70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为健康研究和医疗提供了公平的合成数据，支持更公平的医疗结果。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Conclusion: 为促进主观指标评估领域发展，公开了生成的音乐和人类评估数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements have brought generated music closer to human-created
compositions, yet evaluating these models remains challenging. While human
preference is the gold standard for assessing quality, translating these
subjective judgments into objective metrics, particularly for text-audio
alignment and music quality, has proven difficult. In this work, we generate 6k
songs using 12 state-of-the-art models and conduct a survey of 15k pairwise
audio comparisons with 2.5k human participants to evaluate the correlation
between human preferences and widely used metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first to rank current state-of-the-art music
generation models and metrics based on human preference. To further the field
of subjective metric evaluation, we provide open access to our dataset of
generated music and human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索基础模型在自然科学中是否能编码有意义的物理变量统计关系，并评估其扩展性。

Method: 采用浅层解码器训练预训练模型的潜在表示来预测新变量，并与全模型微调进行对比。

Result: 解码器方法减少了50%的训练时间和35%的内存占用，同时保持高准确性，且其准确性依赖于新变量与预训练变量的物理相关性。

Conclusion: 基础模型在地球科学中的重要质量指标是其能否无需全微调即可扩展到新变量，这为资源有限的社区提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在数学上能表示什么，以及如何通过构造性方法而非训练数据来编程神经网络。

Method: 采用构造性方法，将神经网络视为算法，设计并分析具体示例（如排序算法），研究其递归和并行特性。

Result: 构造了能精确排序输入的神经网络，并发现其具有递归、并行特性，且深度网络优于浅层网络。

Conclusion: 神经网络作为算法具有递归和并行特性，但受限于连续性，深度网络在表达能力上更优。

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer是否能精确学习和实现算法，尤其是k-means聚类这一基础算法。

Result: 实验验证了该Transformer与Lloyd算法的精确对应，并展示了通过修改架构可生成多种聚类变体。

Conclusion: Transformer机制能精确映射到算法过程，为在Transformer中实现精确算法提供了清晰视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

Method: 引入黎曼生成解码器，通过黎曼优化器找到流形值最大似然潜在变量，并训练解码器网络。

Result: 在合成扩散过程、人类迁移和细胞分裂周期三个案例中，验证了方法能捕捉非欧几里得结构并保持几何特性。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需解码器，兼容现有架构，且能生成与数据几何对齐的可解释潜在空间。

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Result: 成功应用于2D高斯混合分布采样，并在10x10振荡器网络中训练生成MNIST数据集的0和1图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习SGMs的非平衡驱动协议提供了一种有效途径，并在实际系统中展示了其潜力。

Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based
generative models (SGMs) can be learned via a local learning rule. The gradient
with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol are computed directly
from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration,
we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators
coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a
mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a network of 10x10
oscillators to sample images of 0s and 1s from the MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: Command-V为模型行为迁移提供了一种高效、无需原始训练数据的方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

Result: 发现“思维锚点”对推理过程有重要影响，通常是规划或回溯句子。

Conclusion: 句子级分析有助于深入理解推理模型，方法一致性验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中大型语言模型的高参数规模和通信效率问题，同时保护隐私。

Result: 在性能上与集中式训练相当，同时显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed是一种高效、隐私保护的分布式大型语言模型微调解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过自然语言将工具知识蒸馏到LLMs中，解决了工具集成推理的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要精确计算或多步代数推理的数学问题上表现不佳，工具集成推理（TIR）虽然能确保正确性，但引入了推理时的依赖性问题。

Method: 构建了一个Solver Agent，通过规划、符号工具调用和反思推理解决数学问题，并通过多LLM代理的反向翻译管道将TIR痕迹转换为自然语言推理痕迹。

Result: 实验表明，在合成的推理痕迹上微调小型开源模型，可以内化工具知识和结构化推理模式，无需推理时工具访问即可提升竞赛级数学基准的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将工具知识蒸馏到LLMs中，解决了TIR的可扩展性和部署问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在联邦学习中如何保护用户隐私的同时，从异构数据中学习共享嵌入和个性化模型的问题。

Method: 基于FedRep算法提出了一种满足差分隐私的联邦学习算法，利用Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换降低维度，并在噪声标签和子高斯分布下提供隐私保护。

Result: 在自然参数范围内，隐私误差项改进了之前的工作，并在二元分类中实现了与维度无关的风险边界。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在隐私保护下实现高效模型个性化的可行性，特别是在异构数据和噪声标签的情况下。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

universality of several recent examples from the literature on positive
definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving
manifold-valued data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in

### [60] [Inference-Time Reward Hacking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19248)
*Hadi Khalaf,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Alex Oesterling,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio du Pin Calmon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）优化中的奖励模型问题，提出了一种通过“对冲”策略避免奖励黑客现象的方法，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型作为优化LLM性能的代理指标存在缺陷，可能导致奖励黑客现象，即过度优化代理奖励而损害真实目标。

Method: 研究了Best-of-$n$ (BoN)和Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN)，并提出了Best-of-Poisson (BoP)方法。此外，引入了HedgeTune算法以优化推理时参数。

Result: 实验表明，对冲策略能有效缓解奖励黑客现象，并在奖励与失真之间实现更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 对冲是一种有效的战术选择，可避免对高代理奖励信号的过度依赖，从而提升模型性能与安全性。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过全局Lipschitz正则化增强行为克隆策略鲁棒性的方法，并验证了其对有界范数扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）在部署时可能因观测误差或对抗性扰动导致策略失效，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 采用全局Lipschitz正则化方法，构建具有Lipschitz性质的神经网络，确保策略对扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验在Gymnasium多个环境中验证了方法的有效性，提供了鲁棒性证明。

Conclusion: 全局Lipschitz正则化能有效增强行为克隆策略的鲁棒性，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;
Behavior Cloning; Lipschitz Neural Network

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图OOD分类中少数类性能下降和对结构噪声敏感的问题。

Method: 提出CMO（约束均值优化）和NNR（邻居感知噪声重加权）两种方法。

Result: 实验验证了方法在合成和真实数据集上的有效性，显著提升了分类准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CMO和NNR有效解决了图OOD分类中的关键问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

TL;DR: BADGNN提出了一种批处理无关的动态图神经网络框架，通过Temporal Lipschitz Regularization和Adaptive Attention Adjustment解决大批次训练中的时序信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图中保持时序连续性至关重要，但传统MDGNNs在大批次训练时会破坏事件序列，导致时序信息丢失和参数收敛困难。

Method: 提出BADGNN框架，包含Temporal Lipschitz Regularization（TLR）控制参数搜索空间扩展，以及Adaptive Attention Adjustment（A3）缓解注意力和批次效应。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，BADGNN在保持高性能的同时支持更大的批次和更快的训练速度。

Conclusion: BADGNN有效解决了动态图神经网络中的时序连续性问题，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的EOCS方法，用于在线继电器设置计算，通过并行图神经网络（PGNN）提取特征，并在测试系统中验证了其高精度和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可再生能源的高渗透和逆变器资源的广泛应用使电力系统运行条件更加多变，现有EOCS方法计算速度无法满足在线需求。

Method: 将电力系统信息分为四层，通过PGNN提取特征，再通过决策网络预测极端运行条件。

Result: 在改进的IEEE 39总线和118总线测试系统中，PGNN方法比现有方法精度更高，计算时间更短。

Conclusion: PGNN方法为在线继电器设置计算提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度SSMs的表达能力，特别是深度和宽度如何影响其性能。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值实验，比较深度和宽度对SSMs表达能力的差异。

Result: 在参数范数约束下，深度SSMs比浅层SSMs更能表示大范数目标，并给出了最小深度的上界。

Conclusion: 深度SSMs在参数约束下具有更强的表达能力，为设计高效模型提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对智能电网中虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）检测的对抗性攻击框架，揭示了现有深度学习模型的高脆弱性，并验证了对抗训练的有效防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网中基于深度学习（DLS）的虚假数据注入攻击检测方案存在被对抗性攻击规避的风险，亟需研究其脆弱性及防御方法。

Method: 利用快速梯度符号法（FGSM）设计对抗性攻击框架，通过微小扰动欺骗深度学习模型，同时评估多种模型（如MLP、CNN、LSTM、ResNet）的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型在对抗性攻击下成功率超过99.7%，而对抗训练显著提升了模型抵御攻击的能力且不影响故障检测准确性。

Conclusion: 对抗性攻击对DLS-based FDIA检测构成严重威胁，智能电网需加强网络安全措施，对抗训练是提升模型鲁棒性的有效手段。

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代诊断工作流多模态化，心电图和胸片是心脏评估的常用模态，但胸片信息丰富而心电图更易获取。CroMoTEX旨在通过胸片训练提升心电图的诊断能力。

Method: 提出CroMoTEX框架，通过监督跨模态对比学习目标对齐心电图和胸片表征，采用自适应硬负样本加权实现任务相关特征学习。测试时仅需心电图输入。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-ECG和MIMIC-CXR数据集上，CroMoTEX在三种病理（心脏肥大、胸腔积液、水肿）上均优于基线，水肿的AUROC达78.31。

Conclusion: CroMoTEX通过跨模态对比学习提升了心电图的诊断能力，适用于实际场景中胸片不可用的情况。

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Motivation: 全球交通事故死亡率高，亟需准确数据支持预防策略和政策制定，但酒精推断不匹配（AIM）问题影响了数据质量。

Method: 开发框架结合BERT模型分析37万+爱荷华州事故记录，使用Probit Logit模型统计AIM模式。

Result: 发现24.03%的AIM率，酒精相关致命事故和夜间事故AIM率较低，未知车型和老年司机事故AIM率较高。

Conclusion: 需针对性培训和数据管理改进，以提高事故报告准确性，支持政策制定。

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting
and support evidence-based policymaking.

Conclusion: DGMAE通过关注节点差异，显著提升了图自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Masked Graph Auto-Encoder, a powerful graph self-supervised training
paradigm, has recently shown superior performance in graph representation
learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Conclusion: Transformer在多样化任务分布中可能自然具备奥卡姆剃刀式的学习能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

Motivation: 电磁结构设计面临高维空间和昂贵评估的挑战，现有方法数据需求高且难以适应实际规模和预算限制。

Method: PQS将传统图像布局转换为四叉树层次表示，并引入一致性驱动样本选择机制，平衡利用和探索。

Result: 在双频选择表面和高增益天线任务中，PQS在有限计算预算下表现优异，比生成方法节省75-85%评估成本。

Conclusion: PQS显著降低了设计周期和计算成本，为电磁结构设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Fourier Neural Operators（FNOs）在处理复杂PDE时因增加傅里叶模式数导致的参数膨胀和超参数调优计算成本高的问题。

Method: 基于Maximal Update Parametrization（μP）框架，数学推导了一种参数化方案，实现超参数在不同傅里叶模式数的FNOs间的迁移。

Result: 实验验证了该技术能有效降低大规模FNOs的超参数调优计算成本，同时保持或提升精度。

Conclusion: μTransfer-FNO为复杂PDE的高效求解提供了一种实用且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于标签的因果发现方法，通过为变量分配多个标签来改进传统基于单一类型的因果发现方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单一类型的因果发现方法缺乏鲁棒性和灵活性，因为变量只能被分配单一类型。

Method: 首先应用现有因果发现方法定向部分边，然后利用这些边确定标签间的边关系，最后用这些关系定向未定向的边。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了因果发现效果，且标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 基于标签的方法优于传统单一类型方法，提供了更强的鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Q值估计中的偏差问题会减慢Q学习和行动者-评论者方法的收敛速度，现代RL算法的成功部分依赖于直接或间接的过估计减少机制。

Conclusion: 该方法简单易实现，能够有效减少过估计问题，提升现有算法的性能。

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Conclusion: FastEGNN和DistEGNN显著提升了大规模等变图学习的效率和能力。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器遗忘（MU）技术快速发展，但其潜在漏洞研究不足，可能导致隐私泄露风险。现有攻击方法需访问原始模型，违背了MU的隐私保护目标。

Method: 采用教师-学生知识蒸馏架构，将遗忘模型作为噪声标注器，将问题转化为带噪声标签学习（LNL）问题。

Result: 实验表明，MRA策略在恢复被遗忘实例的类别成员信息上效果显著。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来MU漏洞研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 大型深度学习模型在噪声标签数据集上性能显著下降，目前缺乏有效的恢复方法。

Method: 采用基于神经科学“遗忘机制”的COLUR框架，通过协同训练架构实现噪声标签影响的遗忘和模型置信度的再学习。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，COLUR在模型恢复和细化方面优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: COLUR框架有效解决了噪声标签导致的模型退化问题，具有显著性能提升。

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Motivation: 自然出现的符号公式中变量常以固定组合出现，通过替换组合减少变量数量可提高符号回归的效率。

Method: 搜索小替换表达式空间并测试其有效性，将有效性测试简化为功能依赖性测试，形成迭代降维过程。

Result: 该方法可靠地识别有效替换，显著提升了多种先进符号回归算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代降维方法能有效减少变量数量，提升符号回归算法的表现。

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证误差的优化可能导致HPO级别的过拟合（即overtuning），但这一现象在HPO和AutoML领域研究较少，因此需要深入探讨。

Method: 通过重新分析HPO基准数据，定义overtuning并区分其与meta-overfitting等概念，评估其普遍性和影响因素。

Result: 研究发现overtuning比预期更常见，约10%情况下会导致选择看似最优但泛化性能更差的配置。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁关注overtuning现象，特别是在小数据场景下，并建议进一步研究缓解策略。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

Method: 采用基于搜索的符号回归方法，寻找ODE的李点对称性生成器。

Result: 成功找到了现有计算机代数系统无法发现的ODE对称性。

Conclusion: 符号回归方法为ODE对称性发现提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

Motivation: 现有方法在嵌入空间中预留空间以容纳新类，但原型偏差和结构固定性限制了空间的表达能力。论文旨在优化特征与结构的一致性，解决FSCIL中的知识冲突。

Method: 设计了基于海马体联想记忆的记忆感知原型校准，提取基础类的语义属性并整合到新类中；提出动态结构匹配，自适应地对齐特征到最优流形空间。

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200基准测试中，ConCM的性能优于现有最优方法，增量会话的调和准确率分别提高了3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM通过特征-结构双重一致性和动态匹配，克服了类数量先验需求，实现了FSCIL中的高性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Conclusion: FAF框架在多任务和少样本时间序列预测中表现出色，能够实现鲁棒且个性化的预测。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

Result: 发现大型模型在全似然方法下性能显著提升，而传统简化统计方法下无改进。

Conclusion: 大型模型结合更多特征可提升预测能力，有助于疾病预测和治疗靶点识别。

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Result: 在1.4B参数模型上验证，OSP模型在4位量化下性能显著提升（平均得分35.7 vs 26.5），且训练开销仅增加2%。

Conclusion: 异常值并非LLM固有特性，而是训练策略的结果，OSP为高效LLM部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data

Conclusion: 不确定性校准对基于扰动的解释质量至关重要，ReCalX能有效提升解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Motivation: 解决时间层次预测中跨粗、细时间尺度的行为预测问题，以优化商业决策。

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

TL;DR: Lookahead Reasoning通过引入步骤级并行性，提升推理模型的解码速度，将SD的峰值加速从1.4倍提高到2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有令牌级推测解码（SD）的加速效果受限于令牌猜测的正确率随长度指数下降，导致速度提升有限。

Method: 提出Lookahead Reasoning，利用轻量级草案模型预测多个未来步骤，目标模型批量扩展这些步骤，并通过验证器筛选语义正确的步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME等基准测试中，Lookahead Reasoning将SD的加速比提升至2.1倍，同时保持答案质量。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning通过结合令牌级和步骤级并行性，显著提升了推理模型的解码效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the
two layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak
speedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other
benchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x
while preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional
GPU throughput. Our code is available at

Motivation: 离线强化学习存在分布外问题，传统方法关注限制算法在分布内采样，而忽略了批量数据的影响。

Method: 从模型优化角度理论分析批量数据与性能的关系，提出无监督数据生成方法（UDG）优化数据选择。

Result: 理论表明状态-动作对分布距离影响性能差距，UDG在未知任务中表现优于监督数据生成。

Conclusion: UDG通过无监督生成和选择数据，有效提升离线强化学习在任务无关设置下的性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

Motivation: 解决正交微调（OFT）的高运行时和内存需求问题，以提升实际部署的可行性。

Method: 提出OFTv2，采用输入中心化重构（矩阵-向量乘法）和Cayley-Neumann参数化，降低计算复杂度。

Result: OFTv2实现了10倍训练速度提升和3倍GPU内存使用降低，且在量化基础模型微调中优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2是一种高效、内存友好的正交微调方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在张量并行训练中需要大量通信同步激活，导致带宽需求高。

Result: 在1B和7B参数模型上，通信需求减少50%，且训练精度无明显下降。

Conclusion: CAAT-Net显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with

activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates

Result: 实验显示，新方法将测试时误分类减少20%，并扩展到自然语言处理任务。

Conclusion: 新方法优于现有技术，且通过消融实验揭示了注释质量的重要性。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上验证了方法的可行性，减少了重复校准的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可证明性能的同时，提升了conformal预测的实用性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Motivation: 灾难性遗忘可以通过保留所有历史任务数据来缓解，但内存占用过大。目标是减少内存需求，同时最大化信息保留。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著提高了平均准确率，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少内存占用方面具有巨大潜力，适用于基于记忆的持续学习算法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

TL;DR: ReBoot是首个支持完全加密和非交互式深度神经网络训练的框架，基于CKKS方案，通过本地误差信号和优化的打包策略显著降低计算开销，并在图像识别和表格数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私问题日益突出，需要能在不泄露敏感信息的情况下进行深度学习的解决方案。现有方法多限于加密推理，加密训练的研究主要集中在逻辑回归或多方计算上。

Method: ReBoot基于CKKS方案，提出了一种HE兼容的神经网络架构，采用本地误差信号减少乘法深度和噪声积累，并通过SIMD操作优化计算和内存开销。

Result: 在图像识别和表格数据上，ReBoot的准确性与32位浮点明文训练相当，比加密逻辑回归和现有加密DNN框架分别提升了3.27%和6.83%，训练延迟降低了8.83倍。

Conclusion: ReBoot为完全加密的深度学习训练提供了高效解决方案，适用于机器学习即服务场景，并已开源供科学社区使用。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

Motivation: 关键基础设施网络（如电网）在自然灾害等破坏后的恢复速度和功能恢复程度至关重要。资源分配是一个复杂的组合优化问题，需要高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种异构图模型，将运输网络和电网合并为一个图，结合图强化学习（GRL）和双图匹配，设计激励函数分配维修任务。采用两种学习技术：基于PPO的图神经网络和Neuroevolution。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和可扩展性，能够高效解决关键基础设施网络的恢复规划问题，优于传统优化方法。

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

Motivation: 尽管CFG在实践中效果显著，但其提升生成质量、细节和提示对齐的机制尚不明确。论文旨在通过频域分析揭示CFG的作用机制，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过频域分析，发现低频引导控制全局结构和条件对齐，高频引导增强视觉保真度。基于此，提出FDG方法，将CFG分解为低频和高频成分，并分别调节其引导强度。

Result: FDG在低引导强度下提升图像质量，避免高CFG强度下的过饱和和多样性损失。实验表明，FDG在多个数据集和模型上均优于标准CFG，提升了样本保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: FDG作为一种即插即用的替代方案，通过频域解耦引导，显著提升了生成模型的性能，为CFG的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变分推断方法在权重空间中使用各向同性高斯近似，无法匹配网络的几何特性，需要更合理的量化方法。

Method: CAP通过von Mises-Fisher分布在单位超球面上建模权重不确定性，并推导了vMF浓度参数与激活噪声方差的解析关系。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，CAP将预期校准误差降低了5.6倍，同时提供了可解释的逐层不确定性分析。

Conclusion: CAP是一种理论严谨且实用的深度学习方法，能无缝集成到标准架构中，计算开销小。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法（如SHAP）无法量化神经网络单元对高维输出的贡献，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过系统地损伤单元组合，MSA生成Shapley模式，即与模型输出维度完全一致的单元贡献图。

Result: MSA在不同规模的模型（从多层感知机到560亿参数的Mixtral-8x7B和GAN）中展示了其有效性，揭示了计算集中、语言特定专家和GAN中的像素生成层次。

Conclusion: MSA是一种强大的工具，可用于解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习架构在数据进入网络后表现优异，但数据准备成为瓶颈。DRIFT旨在通过物理感知方式提取数据中的关键特征，解决信号与噪声混杂的问题。

Method: DRIFT将图像投影到由板的振动模态形状形成的低维基上，生成物理基础的特征集，减少输入维度。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR100上，DRIFT仅需50-100个特征即可实现竞争性分类精度，且训练稳定性、抗过拟合和泛化能力优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DRIFT展示了物理驱动数据转换的强大潜力，将焦点从架构设计转向输入优化，提升了深度学习性能。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了在$\ell_p$-球上的在线凸优化问题，分析了高维和低维情况下的最优遗憾，并探讨了FTRL算法的自适应与非自适应正则化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在不同维度情况下（高维和低维）在线凸优化的最优遗憾表现，以及FTRL算法是否需要自适应正则化才能实现最优性能。

Method: 使用Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL)算法，分析其在时间变化和固定正则化下的表现，并比较不同维度情况下的效果。

Result: 发现自适应正则化的FTRL算法在所有维度情况下都是最优的，而固定正则化则无法同时适应高维和低维情况。此外，高维情况下线性老虎机问题无法实现次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 自适应正则化是实现最优性能的关键，固定正则化无法适应所有维度情况；高维情况下线性老虎机问题的次线性遗憾是不可能的。

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

TL;DR: 交叉正则化通过验证梯度动态调整正则化参数，平衡模型复杂性与过拟合，无需手动调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统正则化方法需要大量手动调参的问题，实现自动平衡模型复杂性与过拟合。

Method: 通过验证梯度动态调整正则化参数，将参数优化分为特征学习和复杂度控制两部分。

Result: 方法在神经网络中表现出高噪声容忍度和架构特定的正则化特性，且能无缝集成数据增强等功能。

Conclusion: 交叉正则化提供了一种高效、自动化的正则化方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO的新框架，扩展了DPO以支持多目标动态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法（如RLHF）计算量大且不稳定，而DPO及其扩展仅支持单一静态偏好分布，限制了灵活性。

Method: 通过分类损失直接对齐语言模型，引入多维度偏好（如帮助性、无害性）和动态插值控制。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，该方法在静态目标上与DPO效果相当，同时更具通用性和适应性。

Conclusion: 新框架为多目标和动态对齐提供了更灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的权重方案，通过自适应调整损失函数的权重，提高了PINNs在求解PDE时的收敛性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在求解PDE时受限于计算资源，通常只能使用有限点集进行优化，导致收敛性和准确性难以保证。

Method: 提出了一种自适应权重方案，将孤立点的损失函数权重扩展到其连续邻域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该权重方案能够显著降低相对$L^2$误差。

Conclusion: 新权重方案有效提升了PINNs的性能，为解决PDE提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线学习变体——模糊在线学习，允许学习者生成多个预测标签，只要至少一个正确且无“可预测错误”即视为正确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多值动态系统、推荐算法和无损压缩等场景中的学习问题，与“苹果品尝”问题相关。

Method: 定义模糊预测和“可预测错误”，基于假设类进行多值预测。

Result: 展示了错误界限的三分法：最优错误界限为Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习在多值场景中具有理论优势，错误界限明确。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术策展主要依赖人类专家的主观判断，缺乏明确规则。研究旨在探索AI是否能通过学习历史展览数据模仿人类策展。

Method: 基于机器学习技术，开发了四种相关模型，利用大都会艺术博物馆25年的展览数据进行训练和验证。

Result: 模型在模仿人类策展方面表现优于随机选择，且通过特征工程和小规模模型设计，效果可媲美大型语言模型。

Conclusion: AI模型在策展中具有潜力，未来通过更多数据可能更接近人类策展的美学和判断。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在训练后如何从训练分布推广到更广泛部署分布的行为，尤其是微调导致的“突发性错位”现象。

Method: 通过强化学习、合成数据集微调等方法诱导突发性错位，并使用稀疏自编码器进行模型差异分析。

Result: 发现控制突发性错位的“错位人格”特征，并验证少量良性样本微调可恢复模型对齐性。

Conclusion: 突发性错位现象普遍存在，但可通过简单干预有效缓解。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MemeMind数据集和MemeGuard框架，用于提升有害模因的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体快速发展导致有害内容传播加剧，现有数据集缺乏系统性、大规模和可解释性，阻碍了有害模因检测的进展。

Method: 提出MemeMind数据集，具有科学标准、大规模、多样性和双语支持；并设计MemeGuard框架，整合多模态信息和推理过程建模。

Result: 实验表明MemeGuard在有害模因检测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind和MemeGuard填补了当前数据集的空白，为有害模因检测提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs可能混淆记忆与推理能力，导致在STEM领域任务中产生高不一致性，尤其在科学和医学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真正学习推理模式，还是仅记忆数据以表现能力，揭示其对自我认知的缺陷。

Method: 采用新框架评估LLMs在训练数据中的推理学习与记忆行为，分析其泛化能力。

Result: LLMs因记忆解决方案而高估自我推理能力，在逻辑一致的任务扰动中表现出45%以上的不一致性。

Conclusion: 当前LLM架构和训练模式存在缺陷，需改进以确保模型对自身知识的认知一致性和可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型对非规范分词具有较高鲁棒性，某些情况下非规范分词甚至能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对训练中未见过的非规范分词的鲁棒性，并探索其潜在优势。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估模型在非规范分词下的性能，并分析不同分词方案的影响。

Result: 指令调优模型在随机分词下保留93.4%性能，字符级分词下保留90.8%。某些任务中，非规范分词可提升性能（如字符级分词提升字符串操作任务14%）。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖低于预期，非规范分词在推理时可能提升性能。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视长文本回复中的偏见和LLM输出的内在变异性，FiSCo旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FiSCo在声明级别操作，利用蕴含检查比较跨群体回复的语义一致性，并通过统计假设检验检测偏见。

Result: FiSCo在合成和人工标注数据集上验证，能更可靠地识别细微偏见，优于现有评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo为LLMs的公平性评估提供了更精细和可靠的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS)的方法，用于改进非自回归文本生成中的并行解码效率，显著减少了推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于置信度或熵的启发式方法在并行解码时无法有效处理多标记间的依赖关系，限制了推理速度。

Method: DUS通过一阶马尔可夫假设将序列位置划分为非相邻标记组，实现并行解码，同时减少去噪器调用次数。

Result: 在数学和代码生成任务中，DUS优于现有并行置信度规划方法，且无需修改去噪器。

Conclusion: DUS为高效高质量文本生成提供了一种轻量级解决方案，释放了掩码扩散语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Motivation: 职位匹配和技能预测在计算职位市场领域具有重要意义，如自动候选人匹配和职业路径预测。

Method: 比较了基于分类的微调、对比学习的微调和提示方法，并利用ESCO的额外数据。

Result: 任务A中提示方法表现最佳（MAP 0.492），任务B中微调分类方法表现最佳（MAP 0.290）。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在两项任务中表现最佳，任务A排名第5/20，任务B排名第3/14。

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

Motivation: 当前评估基准缺乏道德分类的注释和跨文化多样性，限制了LLMs道德推理的透明性和可解释性。

Method: 引入MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条多语言推文，标注了仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本级理由。

Result: LLMs在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但在道德情感预测上较弱（F1<0.35），且在少数语言中理由对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为StorySim的可编程框架，用于生成合成故事以评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的心理理论（ToM）和世界建模（WM）能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准可能受到预训练数据污染的影响，StorySim通过可控的Storyboard生成新颖、组合的故事提示，以精确操纵角色视角和事件。

Method: 使用StorySim设计一阶和二阶ToM任务以及WM任务，控制对心理状态的跟踪和建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，大多数LLMs在WM任务上表现优于ToM任务，且对人类推理优于对无生命物体的推理。还发现了启发式行为的证据，如近因偏差和对早期事件的过度依赖。

Conclusion: StorySim提供了一个有效的工具来评估LLMs的ToM和WM能力，并揭示了模型的行为模式。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的人类对齐忠实度（HAF）标准，用于评估LLMs在毒性解释中的推理能力，并通过六个指标量化其与人类理性解释的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以评估LLMs的自由形式毒性解释，因其过度依赖输入文本扰动等问题。研究旨在提升LLMs在下游任务中的可信度。

Method: 提出HAF标准，开发六个基于不确定性量化的指标，无需人类参与即可全面评估LLMs的毒性解释。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在简单提示下能生成合理解释，但在复杂推理中表现不一致且无意义。

Conclusion: HAF标准有效揭示了LLMs在毒性解释中的局限性，为未来研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合语音和文本优化的方法（J-TAED），通过结合语音和文本输入模态提升ASR准确性，并在推理时仅需语音输入。该方法能统一不同模态的内部表示，并支持基于文本的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音数据稀缺问题，提升跨领域任务的ASR性能。

Method: 联合训练语音和文本输入模态的混合转换器和注意力编码解码器（TAED），推理时仅使用语音输入。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上WER降低5.8~12.8%，在金融和命名实体数据集上分别降低15.3%和17.8%。

Conclusion: J-TAED能有效整合语音和语言信息，支持基于文本的领域适应，显著提升ASR性能。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过不同适应技术（如少样本提示、翻译测试等）提升低资源语言在上下文学习中的表现，发现少样本提示和翻译测试优于梯度方法，并提出了新指标VOR分析性能下降原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在上下文学习中表现不佳的问题，探索最佳适应技术。

Method: 对五种目标语言、三种基础LLM和七项任务进行实验，比较少样本提示、翻译测试、微调等技术的效果。

Result: 少样本提示和翻译测试显著优于梯度方法，性能下降归因于灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的上下文学习提供了实用指导，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多智能体通信协议，结合自然语言和状态转移轨迹，通过状态增量编码（SDE）提升LLM在多任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统主要依赖自然语言通信，导致信息损失，尤其在传递推理逻辑或抽象思维时。

Method: 提出状态增量编码（SDE）方法，传递自然语言标记及标记间的状态转移轨迹，以反映推理过程中的隐藏信息。

Result: 实验表明，采用SDE的多智能体系统在复杂推理任务中表现优于现有通信协议，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: SDE展示了通信增强对LLM多智能体系统的潜力，尤其在复杂推理任务中。

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型和RNN注意力机制的两步方法，用于从长文本中预测五因素模型人格特质，提升了准确性、效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人格评估依赖问卷，而自然语言处理（NLP）通过开放文本提供了新途径。本研究旨在解决长文本（超过2000词）建模的挑战。

Method: 采用两步法：1）通过滑动窗口微调预训练语言模型提取上下文嵌入；2）使用带注意力机制的RNN整合长距离依赖关系。

Result: 通过消融实验和与LLaMA、Longformer等模型的对比，证明了该方法在预测准确性、效率和可解释性上的提升。

Conclusion: 结合语言特征和长文本建模，为基于生活叙事的人格评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺问题并减少标注时间，但现有研究忽视了数据多样性的重要性。

Method: 通过实验分析不同多样性水平的LLM生成数据对模型性能的影响，并研究混合不同比例合成数据的效果。

Result: 适度多样性的LLM生成数据在分布偏移较小时能提升性能，而高多样性数据则对性能有负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来LLM作为数据生成器的应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Motivation: 心理健康护理需求增长，但现有AI咨询系统存在对客户心理状态理解不足、依赖高质量训练数据和隐私问题等挑战。

Method: EmoStage引入视角采纳推断客户心理状态和需求，结合阶段识别确保咨询过程一致性，避免不恰当回应。

Result: 实验表明，EmoStage在日语和中文咨询场景中提升了基础模型的回应质量，与数据驱动方法表现相当。

Conclusion: EmoStage通过创新方法解决了现有AI咨询系统的局限性，展示了在心理健康领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Method: 利用选择性状态空间模型（SSM）Mamba，整合语音特征和提示策略，增强APA和MDD的可解释性和细粒度时间推理。

Result: 在speechocean762基准测试中，模型表现优于现有方法，尤其在MDD任务上。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将语音特征、SSM建模和提示策略结合于CAPT中，为发音反馈提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Motivation: 确保LLM的角色保真度对于维持一致且吸引人的人机交互至关重要，但现有评估方法难以捕捉细微的角色偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能有效检测现有方法忽略的角色不一致性，并揭示了任务结构和角色可欲性对模型适应性的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为角色保真度提供了更精确的评估，揭示了维持一致角色表达的挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Motivation: 当前方法在可靠定位和操作大型语言模型（LLMs）的特征表示方面存在挑战，稀疏自编码器（SAEs）也受限于不完全的特征隔离和不可靠的单义性。

Method: 提出了Feature Monosemanticity Score（FMS）量化特征单义性，并开发了Guided Sparse Autoencoders（G-SAE），通过在训练中条件化标记概念来改进特征表示。

Result: G-SAE在毒性检测、写作风格识别和隐私属性识别等任务中提升了单义性，并实现了更精细的控制，同时减少了质量下降。

Conclusion: 研究为衡量和提升LLMs的机制可解释性和控制提供了实用指南。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上验证了框架的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: VeilProbe在黑盒环境下表现优异，为数据隐私和版权保护提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的语言模型在自然语言推理（NLI）任务中表现优异，但依赖记忆而非基于规则的推理。研究旨在探索如何显式嵌入和记忆推理规则。

Method: 提出了一套完整的学习推理规则的流程，包括三个基于规则的推理任务、理论框架和端到端架构。实验验证了规则在编码器参数空间中的解耦和先验知识注入的效果。

Result: 实验表明，推理规则可以在编码器参数空间中解耦，形成特征空间的聚类；先验知识注入提升了检索效率；数学推理任务中，样本数量增加对性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 通过语言VAEs显式嵌入推理规则，可以提升模型的泛化能力和可解释性，同时揭示了数学推理任务的性能瓶颈和参数分离的优化方向。

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Result: LLMs在分歧预测中表现不佳，RLVR推理反而降低性能。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs在分歧建模中的表现，并重新设计评估方法。

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育中的应用，探讨了其如何通过对话式学习支持高等教育、中学和终身学习，并提出了优化LLM与教育理论对齐的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLM如何通过对话式学习支持教育，并解决其与传统教学理论的差距，如直接提供答案而非促进知识共建。

Method: 结合现有文献和教育理论（如维果茨基的社会文化学习、苏格拉底法和Laurillard的对话框架），分析LLM能力与教学原则的匹配，并提出提示策略和检索增强生成（RAG）以优化教学效果。

Result: LLM在支持个性化学习方面具有潜力，但也存在挑战，如知识共建不足。提出了优化提示设计和检索机制的策略。

Conclusion: 通过优化LLM交互设计，可以更好地将其与教育理论对齐，提升对话式学习的教育效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在高效推理策略下可能引发行为不一致，包括自我矛盾、事后合理化等，需进一步研究其潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究高效推理策略是否会导致模型行为不一致，从而影响其稳健性和可靠性。

Method: 引入ICBENCH基准，从三个维度（任务设置、训练目标与行为、内部推理与自我解释）评估模型不一致性。

Result: 高效推理策略（如No-Thinking和Simple Token-Budget）显著增加不一致性，大模型虽更一致但仍存在广泛问题。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能引入行为不一致风险，需进一步研究其监管影响。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

TL;DR: AnTKV框架通过锚定令牌感知向量量化（Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization）压缩KV缓存，显著降低超低位量化对LLMs性能的影响，支持更长的上下文处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少KV缓存的内存占用，同时最小化超低位量化带来的性能下降。

Method: 提出锚定分数（AnS）量化令牌敏感性，设计AnTKV框架和兼容FlashAttention的Triton内核。

Result: AnTKV在4位设置下优于现有方法，1位和0.375位量化下困惑度显著降低。

Conclusion: AnTKV有效平衡了KV缓存压缩与模型性能，适用于超低位量化场景。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

Result: 混合策略实现了91%的结构化准确性，同时降低了延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 结合NERL和LLM的混合方法在临床应用中具有可扩展性，显著提升了结构化效果。

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在适应新任务时依赖静态预训练知识的问题，避免传统微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 动态构建知识库，通过小知识嵌入模型为LLMs注入任务特定知识。

Result: 在ScienceWorld基准测试中，gpt-4-turbo性能提升17.71%。

Conclusion: KnowMap高效增强LLMs任务适应能力，整合环境与经验知识提升推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于指标的疾病监测方法存在挑战，而在线媒体监测成为流行但手动筛选不切实际。

Method: 使用多阶段信息提取管道，结合ML和非ML方法，从在线文章中提取结构化事件信息。

Result: 处理了3亿多篇新闻文章，识别了9.5万多个独特健康事件，其中3500多个被专家列为潜在爆发。

Conclusion: Health Sentinel有效支持了疾病爆发的早期检测和干预。

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

Motivation: 现有工作依赖Softmax归一化的注意力权重，掩盖了pre-Softmax logits的丰富结构。

Method: 引入RCStat框架，利用RC随机变量衡量token段对齐，并推导高效上界。

Result: 在问答、摘要和归因任务中，RCStat实现显著性能提升，无需模型重训练。

Conclusion: RCStat在压缩和归因任务中达到SOTA性能，展示了原始logits的潜力。

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Result: 结果显示，顶尖自动指标的表现与人类基线相当或更好，表明可能达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 结论指出尽管结果暗示人类水平，但仍需谨慎，并探讨了这对MT评估领域的影响，引发对进步测量的可靠性讨论。

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

Conclusion: ECCoT为LLM提供了一种有效的端到端推理链验证方法，显著提升了其可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

Method: 采用多模态聚合方法，整合用户文本、活动及社交网络数据，评估了Twitter、Gab和Parler三个平台的数据。

Result: 在社交上下文中处理用户文本显著提升了仇恨言论传播者的检测效果，优于传统文本和图方法。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同平台和大规模数据集，能有效分类隐蔽信息并支持干预措施。

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

Motivation: 研究RPT在不同领域中的泛化能力，填补现有研究仅评估同领域数据的空白。

Method: 进行两项研究：观察性研究比较RPT与基础模型在多领域的表现；干预性研究通过单领域RPT微调评估多领域性能。

Result: RPT在类似训练数据的任务上表现显著提升，但在不同推理模式的领域中泛化能力不稳定。

Conclusion: RPT的改进对领域相似性敏感，需谨慎应用于新领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

Motivation: 由于罕见疾病的评估数据难以获取，手动创建临床病例成本高且不切实际，因此需要一种低成本、透明的方法来评估算法更新对诊断性能的影响。

Method: 利用人类表型本体（HPO）的疾病-表型注释生成合成病例，模拟SC访谈以评估算法更新的影响，并通过R平方系数验证方法的有效性。

Result: 实验显示，对于HPO中包含频率信息的疾病，该方法能有效预测算法更新后的性能变化（R²=0.831和0.78）；但对于无频率信息的疾病，预测误差较大。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical

developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases

costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于线性复杂度循环注意力（RA）层的长语音识别方法，解决了多头注意力（MHA）在长语音识别中计算复杂度高的问题。RA在短语音和长语音任务中均能达到与MHA相当的精度，且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多头注意力（MHA）在长语音识别中因二次复杂度导致的效率问题，探索更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 采用线性复杂度的双向循环注意力（RA）层，提出长语音训练范式，并引入方向丢弃（Direction Dropout）正则化方法。

Result: RA在精度上与MHA相当，但效率更高；长语音训练范式使RA比有限上下文注意力（LCA）精度更高且吞吐量提升44%。

Conclusion: RA是一种高效且准确的长语音识别方法，方向丢弃正则化进一步优化了精度与效率的权衡。

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中取得了显著进展，但如何最优整合SFT和RL仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析标记分布和学习动态，提出SRFT方法，结合SFT和RL的优势，直接优化LLM。

Result: SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达59.1%，优于零RL方法9.0%。

Conclusion: SRFT通过统一SFT和RL，显著提升了LLM在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量网络文本以丰富预训练数据，实验显示混合高质量与改写文本能提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文档使其可用于训练，增加合成数据在预训练集中的比例。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量与改写文本分别提升1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Result: 发现战略规划质量是模型性能的关键因素，交互设计和任务复杂性影响推理能力，数据质量比多样性更重要。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，开发了一种数据合成方法，显著提升了开源LLMs的分析推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks,
yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of
reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to
enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed
dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

Method: 采用微调的BanglaBERT模型，并通过数据增强和集成模型优化性能，同时使用LIME进行模型解释。

Result: 微调模型和集成模型的宏F1分数分别为0.60和0.63，但模型在上下文理解上仍有局限。

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

Motivation: 为了解决YOLOv8在细粒度识别任务（如车牌读取和车辆属性分类）上的不足，并实现车辆碳排放的自动化精确计算。

Method: 采用增强版YOLOv8架构进行车辆检测、分割和跟踪，结合深度OCR模块识别车牌，并通过外部数据库验证信息。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能交通系统中的车辆碳排放监测提供了可扩展的解决方案，验证了实时目标检测与深度OCR结合的可行性。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Motivation: 传统的PD运动评估（如手指敲击测试）依赖主观视觉评价，存在评分者间和评分者内变异性，且无法捕捉个体运动特征。

Method: 通过视频分析提取四组临床相关特征（运动减少、运动迟缓、序列效应和犹豫停顿），并利用主成分分析和机器学习分类器预测MDS-UPDRS评分。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD运动特征提供了客观评估工具，适用于临床和远程场景，未来需验证其对症状治疗和疾病进展的响应性。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Conclusion: 该方法高效处理复杂拓扑，不依赖先验知识，保持全局路径一致性。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Abstract: The tower crane is involving more automated and intelligent operation

Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the
human workers on the workspace between the tower crane and constructed building
top area (construction top) from the bird's-eye view, especially with Modular

tower crane lifting from the bird's-eye view, surveilling to shield the human
workers on the construction top and avoid cranes' collision by alarming the
crane operator. The system achieved a 3D data fusion for localization of humans

we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the
accuracy and effectiveness of the involved methods. The display and

Result: Damba-ST在预测任务中表现优异，具备零样本泛化能力，无需大量微调即可部署到新环境。

Conclusion: Damba-ST通过创新设计解决了时空异构性问题，实现了高效且泛化的城市时空预测。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中因尺度变化、方向多样和语义模糊带来的挑战。

Method: 提出DiffRIS框架，包含上下文感知适配器（CP-adapter）和渐进式跨模态解码器（PCMRD），增强跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffRIS通过预训练扩散模型和自适应框架，为遥感图像分割任务设定了新的标杆。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于可视化大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在开放式视觉问答（VQA）中依赖的显著图像区域，并揭示多模态文本显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LVLM在生成自由形式文本响应时的视觉注意力分布，对于诊断幻觉、暴露偏见和确保透明度至关重要。

Method: GLIMPSE结合梯度加权注意力、自适应层传播和加权令牌聚合，生成响应级别的归因热图。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为分析LVLM的跨模态推理提供了细粒度的可解释性工具，有助于理解模型行为并提升透明度。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

TL;DR: 论文提出T2MD方法，通过蒸馏技术将自注意力扩散模型转换为线性复杂度的Mamba模型，实现高效高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在扩散变换器中的二次计算复杂度导致高分辨率图像生成成本高昂，而直接训练Mamba模型存在困难。

Method: 提出扩散变换器到Mamba的蒸馏（T2MD），结合自注意力和Mamba的混合模型，采用层级教师强制和特征知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明T2MD能以低成本生成高质量图像，并验证了Mamba模型用于非因果视觉输出的可行性。

Conclusion: T2MD为高效高分辨率图像生成提供了可行路径，并展示了Mamba模型在视觉生成中的潜力。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

Result: 在多个持续TTA基准测试中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: OoPk方法有效解决了CTTA中的关键挑战，提升了语义分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music

strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

Conclusion: HAWAII框架有效结合多专家优势，显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基础模型行为的涌现特性，但也指出了在敏感领域（如心理健康和教育）中存在的捷径学习、偏见和公平性问题。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于小型和稀有野生动物（如草原犬鼠）的生态重要性与其难以检测的特性之间的矛盾，现有方法效果不佳，因此需要一种更有效的检测方法。

Method: RareSpot结合了多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强技术，前者通过特征金字塔的结构对齐增强细粒度对象表示，后者通过合成具有挑战性的训练样本提升模型性能。

Result: 在专家标注的草原犬鼠无人机图像基准测试中，RareSpot的检测精度比基线方法提高了35%以上，并在其他野生动物数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RareSpot不仅为生态监测提供了重要工具，还为复杂空中场景中小型稀有物种的检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Conclusion: 该方法在保证编辑质量的同时大幅提升效率，为图像编辑提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

Conclusion: PrITTI展示了基元表示在3D场景生成中的潜力，提供了高效、可控且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态跟踪在低光照和恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，多模态跟踪（如RGB-T）利用互补数据提升性能，但现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 采用MobileViT设计渐进式融合框架，联合学习模板和搜索区域的模态内和模态间交互，使用可分离注意力生成高效特征表示。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122帧/秒，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT应用于RGB-T跟踪，实现了轻量化和高效性，代码和模型权重将公开。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: PRISM是一种可扩展的工具，适用于实时和资源受限环境，能有效分析和审核敏感媒体。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

Abstract: We introduce OpenWildlife (OW), an open-vocabulary wildlife detector designed
for multi-species identification in diverse aerial imagery. While existing
automated methods perform well in specific settings, they often struggle to
generalize across different species and environments due to limited taxonomic
coverage and rigid model architectures. In contrast, OW leverages
language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: MedErr-CT是一个新的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在CT报告中识别和纠正错误的能力，旨在提高临床诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查需求的增加，诊断错误的问题日益突出，而现有的医学视觉问答（VQA）基准测试缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识。

Method: 通过VQA框架，MedErr-CT评估MLLMs在六类错误（四种视觉相关错误和两种词汇错误）上的表现，分为分类、检测和纠正三个任务级别。

Result: 评估发现，现有3D医学MLLMs在不同错误类型上的表现存在显著差异。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高临床准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: Video-XL-2是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过任务感知的KV稀疏化技术，显著提升了长视频理解的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临高内存和计算成本的问题，难以同时实现高性能和高效率。

Method: 采用分块预填充和双层键值解码技术，分块内使用全注意力，分块间使用稀疏注意力，并根据任务相关性选择性加载键值。

Result: Video-XL-2在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，并能在单块NVIDIA A100 GPU上高效处理超过10,000帧视频。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新的稀疏化技术，成功解决了长视频理解中的性能和效率挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法主要针对单模态语言模型，无法应对多模态输入带来的复杂安全威胁，且当前数据集缺乏细粒度的政策推理支持。

Method: 通过构建高质量的多模态安全推理数据集MSR-Align，支持跨视觉和文本模态的细粒度、政策基础的推理，并采用严格的质量过滤。

Result: 实验表明，基于MSR-Align微调的VLMs显著提升了对抗文本和视觉语言越狱攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持或提升一般推理性能。

Conclusion: MSR-Align为提升推理能力VLMs的安全性对齐提供了可扩展且有效的基础，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

Result: 实验证明生成的数据能有效训练深度学习模型，用户研究显示AIR获得4.4/5的高分。

Conclusion: AIR框架为图像识别任务提供了高效、可靠的数据生成和模型训练解决方案。

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种3D选择性扫描模块（3D-SSM）以解决现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中长距离依赖捕获不足的问题，并基于此设计了时空交互模块（SIM）和多分支特征提取模块（MBFEM），实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中无法有效捕获图像通道间的长距离依赖，限制了特征表示能力。

Method: 提出3D-SSM模块捕获全局信息，并设计SIM和MBFEM模块分别用于时空特征交互和多分支特征提取。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3D-SSM及相关模块显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域适应中域分布不匹配和目标域判别性不足的问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN方法在无监督域适应中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The

Motivation: 现有水道感知模型缺乏全局语义理解能力，限制了大规模监控和结构化日志生成。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）构建WaterCaption数据集，并提出Da Yu模型，采用NTA平衡计算效率与视觉特征建模能力。

Result: Da Yu在WaterCaption及其他描述基准测试中表现优异，平衡了性能与效率。

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境的视觉地理理解和空间场景认知提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有4D高斯溅射和动态NeRF方法在长时间捕捉中训练开销大，HoliGS旨在提供更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: 将场景分解为静态背景和时间变化对象，通过可逆高斯溅射变形网络实现全局刚性变换、骨架驱动和细微非刚性变形。

Result: HoliGS在挑战性数据集上实现了更优的重建质量，显著减少了训练和渲染时间。

Conclusion: HoliGS为现实场景中的EVS提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Result: 在OVCOS和传统伪装物体分割基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过VLM语义的丰富性，有效提升了伪装物体的分割和分类性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Conclusion: LM-AD通过引入AQM模块，显著提升了3D点云功能检测的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Result: 在三个图像数据集和八个视频数据集上的实验验证了PMC框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态跨域视觉识别任务中表现出色，特别是在处理模态缺失问题时具有优势。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

through an innovative and cost-effective method for constructing synthetic 3D
scenes with fine-grained part-level annotations, paving the way for advanced
3D-part scene understanding. On the methodological side, we propose OpenPart3D,
a 3D-input-only framework to effectively tackle the challenges of part-level

in open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks at the part level, with strong

Conclusion: Chan-Vese模型适用于复杂分割任务，具有实际成像应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.
This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex
segmentation tasks and highlights its potential for use in real-world imaging

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无需训练的方法在蒸馏视频生成模型中难以实现运动定制，因生成过程加速和大去噪步长导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 利用扩散教师强制（teacher forcing），通过端点预测和插值，动态分配计算资源以保持效率。

Result: 实验表明，MotionEcho显著提高了运动保真度和生成质量，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: MotionEcho为蒸馏视频生成模型提供了一种高效且无需训练的运动定制解决方案。

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下稳定建模组织几何和变形，为机械分析提供了额外模态。

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要定制化训练策略以加速VLM的文本理解能力，为未来多模态学习优化奠定基础。

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Method: 引入分层扩散降尺度（HDD）模型，采用从粗到细的分层采样过程，减少计算像素数量。

Result: 在ERA5和CMIP6数据集上表现优异，计算负荷显著降低，且模型可跨分辨率迁移。

Conclusion: HDD为概率气候降尺度提供了轻量高效的替代方案，支持大规模高分辨率气候预测。

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过事件流特征实现了高效的MAV检测，并发布了首个事件基MAV数据集，为社区提供了新资源。

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块的有效结合，显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Conclusion: 通过抑制特征而非添加额外信息，可以解决样本分布不对齐问题，提高图像归因分析的可信度。

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout
all experimental models.

Result: 数据集包含42,000对图像，覆盖多种场景和运动类型，测试显示现有SOTA模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该数据集为开发鲁棒和泛化的去模糊模型提供了新的挑战性基准。

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with
varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art
(SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance
degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our
dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and
generalizable deblurring models.

*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的CT报告生成方法，通过循环视觉特征提取和立体注意力机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用CT切片间的关联和多层次特征，特别是特定器官病变信息，影响了报告生成的准确性。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer循环处理CT切片，并通过立体注意力机制选择重要视觉信息，与文本特征对齐，指导LLM生成报告。

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上超越基线模型，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合了CT切片的多层次特征，显著提升了报告生成的准确性和效果。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决真实图像数据集难以获取、隐私和法律问题，以及现有合成数据训练模型性能不足的问题。

Method: 1. 改进神经分形生成新合成数据；2. 提出反向风格化技术，将小规模真实图像特征迁移到合成数据中。

Result: KID显示分布差距显著降低；EDM2扩散模型FID降低11%，ViT-S分类模型在ImageNet-100上准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏大规模真实数据时的模型训练提供了实用解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

Result: USIS16K数据集在多样性、复杂性和可扩展性方面显著提升，为USIS研究提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: USIS16K数据集和基准模型将促进水下显著实例分割领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMSViT是一种新型的分层掩码自监督视觉变换器，用于角膜神经分割和糖尿病周围神经病变诊断，通过高效的多尺度特征提取和自监督学习，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）影响近半数糖尿病患者，需要早期检测。现有的自动诊断方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足等问题。

Method: HMSViT采用基于池化的分层和双重注意力机制，结合绝对位置编码，实现高效多尺度特征提取。设计了块掩码自监督学习框架，减少对标注数据的依赖，并使用多尺度解码器进行分割和分类。

Result: 在临床CCM数据集上，HMSViT在神经分割任务中达到61.34% mIoU，诊断准确率为70.40%，优于Swin Transformer和HiViT等模型。

Conclusion: HMSViT在性能和计算效率上均表现出色，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Motivation: 现有合成场景缺乏现实基础，难以验证结果的相关性，而编辑模型虽利用真实驾驶数据，但仍面临3D一致性、空街先验学习和配对数据生成等挑战。

Result: SceneCrafter在真实性、可控性、3D一致性和编辑质量上达到最优，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SceneCrafter为驾驶场景编辑提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了模拟的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，生成的描述更丰富、准确，并成功用于VQA和图像重建任务。

Conclusion: ScaleCap通过可扩展的推理策略显著提升了图像描述的质量和多样性。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注感知能力，忽视了推理能力导致的视觉幻觉，这在安全关键应用中存在风险。

Method: 开发了PRE-HAL数据集，并提出基于Dempster-Shafer理论的检测方法，通过不确定性估计捕捉高级特征冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种LVLMs上优于五种基线不确定性指标，AUROC平均提升4%、10%和7%。

Conclusion: 新方法和数据集能有效检测和评估LVLMs的视觉幻觉，尤其在关系推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kVCT图像中的伪影影响临床决策，传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，通过特征重校准减少伪影并保留解剖结构，生成MVCT样重建。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证了模型的有效性，能够生成高质量的MVCT样图像。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了重复高剂量MVCT扫描的需求，降低了癌症患者的辐射暴露，提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了面部识别系统对自然触发器后门攻击的检测和识别能力。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Result: 结果表明，定制数据预训练效果显著优于通用模型，且无需超参数调整或方法创新即可实现高性能。

Conclusion: 结论指出，在资源有限的情况下，应避免过度追求方法创新，专注于定制数据预训练即可获得优异结果。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Motivation: 解决状态空间模型（SSMs）在二维视觉数据中适应性问题，避免复杂修改带来的效率损失。

Method: 采用四阶段分层设计，结合门控CNN块和傅里叶滤波门模块，在频域中高效提取全局特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上达到SOTA性能，如UC Merced（98.41% F1）和AID（95.99% F1），参数更少。

Conclusion: MambaOutRS证明门控卷积和频域模块可替代复杂SSMs，为高效深度学习模型提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型通常针对单一传感器或固定组合，限制了跨传感器的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Result: 在单模态和多模态任务中，SMARTIES优于依赖传感器特定预训练的模型。

Conclusion: SMARTIES为多传感器遥感数据处理提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and

### [223] [Vision Transformer-Based Time-Series Image Reconstruction for Cloud-Filling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19591)
*Lujun Li,Yiqun Wang,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer（ViT）的时间序列多光谱图像（MSI）重建框架，结合合成孔径雷达（SAR）数据，解决云覆盖导致的MSI数据缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云覆盖导致多光谱图像（MSI）数据缺失或损坏，影响早期作物监测。SAR数据不受云干扰但缺乏光谱细节，需结合两者优势。

Method: 提出Time-series ViT框架，利用MSI的时间一致性和SAR的互补信息，通过注意力机制重建云覆盖区域的MSI数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列MSI和SAR或仅使用时间序列MSI的基线方法。

Conclusion: Time-series ViT框架有效提升了云覆盖区域MSI图像的重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

multimodal sensing to acquire diverse environment information. During the
experiment, we conducted both indoor and outdoor experiments, and compared with
the standard guide cane. The result shows superior performance of our device in
blind guidance.

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上，NVSF在LiDAR和Camera领域均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NVSF是一种高效、自监督的多模态动态场景表示框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera
domain. Code of the model is available at

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏可靠的室内场景数据集，尤其是在包含人物的场景中，因此需要构建一个能够准确标注人物与物体关系的合成数据集。

Method: 通过生成场景图的结构化表示，结合RGB图像、分割掩码、深度图像和人体关键点，计算物体与人物之间的参数化关系。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在推动涉及人物的场景理解研究，为导航和规划等任务提供支持。

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

*Letian Kang,Shixian Luo,Yiqiang Li,Xiaoyang Yu,Shenxuan Zhou,Yong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEVLM是一种并行编码策略，旨在提高视觉语言模型（VLMs）的长视频理解效率，无需微调模型，显著降低计算复杂度并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的应用，需要一种高效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: PEVLM通过将输入分块处理、保留全注意力位置嵌入并调整注意力权重以模拟全注意力分布，从而降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM实现了8.37%的精度提升、7.47倍的注意力计算加速和40%的端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解中表现优异，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xarrayvideo是一个Python库，通过将多通道时空数据集编码为视频，利用ffmpeg优化视频编解码器，实现高达250倍的压缩比，同时保持高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理大规模地球系统数据集时，其空间、时间和光谱冗余性类似于标准视频，因此可以利用视频压缩技术来高效压缩这些数据。

Method: 使用xarrayvideo库将多通道时空数据集编码为视频，利用ffmpeg的标准视频编解码器进行压缩。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上测试，压缩比高达250倍，PSNR值在0.1和1 bpppb时表现优异，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效处理大型地球观测数据集的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

*Yang Xing,Jiong Wu,Yuheng Bu,Kuang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP框架通过支持集引导提示和低秩适应策略，解决了SAM2在医学图像分割中的手动提示依赖和领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2在医学图像分割中依赖人工提示且存在领域偏移问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出SAM2-SGP框架，包括伪掩码生成模块（PMG）和伪掩码注意力模块（PMA），并采用低秩适应（LoRA）策略。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有模型（如nnUNet、SwinUNet、SAM2和MedSAM2）。

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP通过自动化提示和领域适应，有效提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要准确的分子信息，但直接从基因组学获取成本高且耗时，限制了临床应用。

Method: PathLUPI在训练中使用转录组特权信息，提取基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，仅需全切片图像即可推断分子特征。

Result: 在49项分子肿瘤学任务中，PathLUPI表现优于传统方法，14项任务AUC≥0.80，5种癌症生存队列C-index≥0.70。

Conclusion: PathLUPI通过编码分子上下文优化全切片图像表征，为临床病理工作流提供了新策略。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声图像因参数差异导致的视觉变异性问题，并满足非专业用户（如即时护理场景）对图像解读和扫描指导的需求。

Method: 引入超声图像场景图（SG），通过变压器模型单阶段计算SG，无需显式目标检测；结合LLMs生成用户查询的细化解释，并利用SG指导扫描缺失解剖结构。

Result: 在五名志愿者的颈部和甲状腺图像上验证了方法的有效性，提升了超声的解读和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法有望通过增强超声的解读和易用性，使其更广泛地普及。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

TL;DR: UltraAD是一种基于视觉语言模型的方法，通过少量超声图像样本实现异常定位和细粒度分类，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像中异常检测的细粒度区分不足和超声图像因设备和参数变化导致的域差距问题。

Method: 结合视觉原型和文本嵌入进行图像级和局部特征融合，构建记忆库以对齐医学数据特征。

Result: 在三个乳腺超声数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraAD在异常定位和细粒度分类方面具有显著优势，适用于临床决策。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出启发式方法优化投影模型选择，发布数据集支持广视角下姿态估计研究。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D合成方法在对象级生成或动态场景合成方面存在局限性，无法生成多视角一致且沉浸的动态4D场景。

Method: CoCo4D将4D场景合成分为动态前景和背景建模，利用参考运动序列指导生成。结合视频扩散模型和渐进式外绘方案，优化前景轨迹以实现无缝融合。

Conclusion: CoCo4D通过分治策略和优化技术，成功解决了动态4D场景生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on
our website https://colezwhy.github.io/coco4d/.

TL;DR: ProtoSolo是一种新型的深度神经网络架构，通过单原型激活实现可解释的图像分类，简化解释复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型网络依赖多个原型协作决策，增加了认知复杂度。ProtoSolo旨在通过单原型激活简化分类和解释过程。

Method: 1. 仅需单原型激活完成分类；2. 使用特征图而非全通道特征向量进行相似性比较；3. 提出非原型投影学习策略。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上，ProtoSolo在分类任务中表现优异，解释复杂度达到最佳水平。

Conclusion: ProtoSolo通过单原型激活和特征图比较，显著提升了分类性能和解释的简洁性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head

single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户对高分辨率视频生成的需求增加，仅依赖潜在计算已不足，需探索更高效的方法。

Method: 提出两种退化策略生成训练对以匹配基础模型输出特性，并分析时间步采样策略和噪声增强对VSR模型的影响，引入交错时间单元和稀疏局部注意力以降低计算开销。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有技术，消融研究验证了各设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为级联视频超分辨率生成提供了简单有效的基线，为未来高效合成系统的发展提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

TL;DR: Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM) 是一种简单有效的渐进生成视觉媒体的框架，通过独立应用 Flow Matching 在多尺度表示中，显著提升了图像和视频的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维视觉模态生成的计算密集型问题，同时避免多阶段架构的复杂性和定制化需求。

Method: DFM 在用户定义的多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级上独立应用 Flow Matching。

Result: 在 Imagenet-1k 512px 上，DFM 在 FDD 分数上比基础架构提升了 35.2%，比最佳基线提升了 26.4%，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: DFM 通过单一模型和架构简化，显著提升了生成质量，且无需对现有训练流程进行大量修改。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

TL;DR: GenHSI是一种无需训练的方法，通过分阶段生成长视频，解决了现有视频生成模型在人类-场景交互中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模预训练视频扩散模型在生成长电影式视频时面临人类-场景交互不真实、主体身份保留不足和训练成本高的问题。

Method: GenHSI将长视频生成任务分为三个阶段：脚本编写、预可视化和动画，利用3D关键帧和现成视频扩散模型生成一致性视频。

Result: 实验表明，GenHSI能从单张场景图像生成长视频，有效保留场景内容和角色身份，实现合理的人类-场景交互。

Conclusion: GenHSI首次实现了无需训练的生成长视频序列，具有一致的相机姿态和任意数量的角色动作。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于2D图像质量评估（IQA）的新视角选择方法，替代传统3D不确定性最小化或信息增益最大化的方法，显著提升了效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FisheRF和ActiveNeRF）需要针对不同3D表示进行专门设计，且在3D空间中建模复杂。本文旨在简化流程，通过2D图像质量评估实现高效视角选择。

Method: 将视角选择问题转化为2D图像质量评估任务，利用多视图上下文训练模型预测SSIM，指导选择渲染质量最低的视角。

Result: 方法在标准基准测试中取得显著定量和定性提升，且与3D表示无关，运行速度比现有方法快14-33倍。

Conclusion: 通过2D图像质量评估框架，实现了高效、通用的视角选择，为3D重建和新视角合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel

variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

Conclusion: UniVLA通过统一建模和世界建模，显著提升了长期任务的性能，并在仿真和实际应用中展示了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动合成方法受限于固定骨骼拓扑或需要高成本优化，AnimaX旨在将视频运动知识高效迁移到3D领域。

Method: AnimaX将3D运动表示为多视角、多帧2D姿态图，通过联合视频-姿态扩散生成运动，利用共享位置编码和模态感知嵌入确保时空对齐。

Result: 在160,000个新数据集上训练，AnimaX在VBench上实现泛化性、运动保真度和效率的领先表现。

Conclusion: AnimaX为类别无关的3D动画提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Motivation: 视频扩散模型的高计算成本限制了长视频的生成能力，作者发现时空能量衰减现象，并利用这一现象设计更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，一种基于时空距离的稀疏注意力机制，计算复杂度为O(n log n)，并通过LoRA微调扩展预训练模型的生成长度。

Result: 实验表明，Radial Attention在多个数据集上保持视频质量，计算效率提升1.9倍，训练成本降低4.4倍，推理速度提升3.7倍。

Conclusion: Radial Attention是一种高效且可扩展的注意力机制，显著降低了视频扩散模型的计算负担，适用于长视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了医疗影像黑盒模型在现实条件下对模型窃取（MS）攻击的脆弱性，并提出了一种名为QueryWise的两步模型窃取方法，使用公开数据集和有限查询预算成功克隆模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在医疗影像中应用广泛，但模型窃取攻击对其的威胁尚未充分研究，尤其是在缺乏训练数据和有限查询预算的现实条件下。

Method: 提出QueryWise方法，利用代理分布的无标签数据训练窃取模型，无需额外查询。实验在胆囊癌和COVID-19分类模型上进行验证。

Result: 研究表明，攻击者能有效利用公开数据集执行MS攻击，QueryWise方法在有限查询预算下显著提升了窃取能力。

Conclusion: 医疗影像模型对MS攻击高度脆弱，QueryWise方法为防御此类攻击提供了新视角。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.
