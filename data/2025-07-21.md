Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT是一种基于图的架构，解决了传统链式系统在智能交通管理中的效率问题，通过并行执行和动态资源分配显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于链式系统的LLM（如TrafficGPT）在复杂交通场景中存在顺序任务执行、高令牌使用和扩展性差的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出GraphTrafficGPT，将任务及其依赖关系表示为有向图中的节点和边，通过Brain Agent分解查询、构建依赖图，并协调多个专业代理。

Result: 实验显示，GraphTrafficGPT比TrafficGPT减少50.2%的令牌消耗和19.0%的响应延迟，同时支持多查询并行处理，效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT通过图结构和并行处理显著提升了LLM在智能交通管理中的效率和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

### [2] [PrefPalette: Personalized Preference Modeling with Latent Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13541)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Melanie Sclar,Hunter Lang,Ansong Ni,Jacqueline He,Puxin Xu,Andrew Cohen,Chan Young Park,Yulia Tsvetkov,Asli Celikyilmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PrefPalette框架通过分解偏好属性并基于社区价值观预测偏好，显著优于GPT-4o，并提供可解释的社区特定洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，无法理解偏好的深层原因，PrefPalette旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多属性决策原则，PrefPalette通过合成反事实属性和基于注意力的偏好建模，动态学习不同社区的属性权重。

Result: 在Reddit的45个社区中，PrefPalette的平均预测准确率比GPT-4o高46.6%，并揭示了社区特定的偏好特征。

Conclusion: PrefPalette不仅提升了偏好预测性能，还提供了透明、可解释的洞察，为更具信任感和价值感知的个性化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

### [3] [GOFAI meets Generative AI: Development of Expert Systems by means of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13550)
*Eduardo C. Garrido-Merchán,Cristina Puente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）与符号系统的新方法，通过结构化提示生成可验证的Prolog知识表示，确保专家系统的可解释性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成信息时可能产生的幻觉或错误事实的问题，开发可控且透明的专家系统。

Method: 采用结构化提示方法，限制领域范围，生成Prolog符号表示，并由人类专家验证和修正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在事实准确性和语义连贯性上表现优异，结合了LLMs的召回能力和符号系统的精确性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种透明混合解决方案，为敏感领域构建可靠AI应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

### [4] [Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558)
*David Poole*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了当前AI主要建模像素和文字，而忽略了实体及其关系的重要性，并分析了关系学习未普及的原因及改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要关注像素和文字的建模，但世界由实体及其关系构成，关系学习（如统计关系AI）应更受重视。

Method: 分析了关系学习未普及的原因，并探讨了如何改进以提升其重要性。

Result: 关系学习目前仅在有限领域应用，需进一步改进以扩大影响。

Conclusion: 关系学习应成为AI的核心方向，需更多研究和实践以实现其潜力。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

### [5] [BifrostRAG: Bridging Dual Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Construction Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13625)
*Yuxin Zhang,Xi Wang,Mo Hu,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BifrostRAG是一个双图RAG系统，通过结合实体网络图和文档导航图，显著提升了多跳问题回答的准确性和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG系统在处理复杂法规文本和多跳查询时的局限性。

Method: 采用双图架构（实体网络图和文档导航图），结合图遍历和向量语义搜索。

Result: 在多跳问题数据集上，BifrostRAG的精确率为92.8%，召回率为85.5%，F1得分为87.3%。

Conclusion: BifrostRAG为复杂技术文档的知识检索提供了可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

### [6] [Buggy rule diagnosis for combined steps through final answer evaluation in stepwise tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13651)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于最终答案的自动错误诊断方法，用于解决学生在分步任务中合并步骤导致的组合爆炸问题。通过实验验证，该方法能有效诊断29.4%的步骤，并与教师诊断结果高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在分步任务中合并步骤会导致可能的路径组合爆炸，增加错误诊断难度。利用最终答案进行诊断可以减少组合复杂性。

Method: 设计了一种基于最终答案的错误诊断服务，通过自动完成任务并根据任务策略诊断解决方案。实验使用二次方程求解的学生数据集验证方法。

Result: 该方法能诊断29.4%的未诊断步骤，与教师诊断结果在97%的情况下一致。

Conclusion: 基于最终答案的错误诊断方法具有潜力，可作为进一步研究的基础。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

### [7] [Combining model tracing and constraint-based modeling for multistep strategy diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13652)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型追踪和约束建模的方法，用于诊断学生在多步任务中的输入，并在解决二次方程的数据集上验证了其与人工诊断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合模型追踪和约束建模的优势，以更灵活地诊断学生输入，尤其是在学生将多个步骤合并为一步时。

Method: 通过定义约束作为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，开发了一个多步策略诊断系统，并在二次方程数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 系统诊断与教师编码在所有140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种诊断范式，能够准确诊断学生的多步输入，且与人工诊断结果一致。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

### [8] [DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal Sensors and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13737)
*Ye Tian,Xiaoyuan Ren,Zihao Wang,Onat Gungor,Xiaofan Yu,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DailyLLM是一个基于轻量级LLM的框架，通过整合多维度上下文信息（位置、运动、环境和生理）生成和总结活动日志，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有活动日志生成方法在准确性、效率和语义丰富性上存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: DailyLLM采用轻量级LLM框架，结合结构化提示和高效特征提取，实现高级活动理解。

Result: 实验表明，DailyLLM在BERTScore精度上比70B参数的SOTA基线提升17%，推理速度快10倍。

Conclusion: DailyLLM为活动日志生成提供了高效、准确的解决方案，适合在资源有限的设备上部署。

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

*Carlos Bobed,Carlota Quintana,Eduardo Mena,Jorge Bobed,Fernando Bobillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntView是一个新型的本体可视化工具，旨在通过直观的图形界面展示本体概念及其关系，解决了现有工具在可视化大型本体时的信息过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本体可视化工具无法有效展示复杂本体结构，尤其是缺乏对General Concept Inclusions (GCI)的支持，导致用户难以理解大型本体的依赖关系。

Method: OntView基于DL推理器，采用“所见即所意”范式，动态展示推理知识，并提供简化视图功能（如本体摘要、TBox元素聚焦和动态分支隐藏）。

Result: OntView成功实现了对GCI的可视化，并通过多种简化视图功能减轻了信息过载问题，工具已开源。

Conclusion: OntView为本体可视化提供了更直观和灵活的方式，尤其适用于大型复杂本体的理解和分析。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策引擎通常选择最佳规则，而本研究旨在通过语义交互建模和修辞框架，将冲突的启发式融合为连贯且上下文敏感的叙述。

Method: 结合经典军事理论和现代企业战略，通过语义相互依赖的过程激活和组合多种启发式。

Result: 通过Meta vs. FTC案例研究展示了框架的可行性，并通过语义指标进行了初步验证。

Conclusion: 讨论了动态干扰调谐等局限性和扩展方向。

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级框架，用于动态图中的时间链接预测，通过结合短期时间最近性和长期全局结构模式，显著提高了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T-GNN在建模时间和结构依赖时存在计算开销大、效率低的问题，需要一种更轻量且高效的方法。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，通过自适应权重机制动态调整两者贡献，避免复杂计算。

Result: 在七个真实世界时间图上，EAGLE在性能和效率上均优于现有T-GNN，速度提升超过50倍。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过轻量设计解决了T-GNN的效率问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统知识转移方法在多智能体强化学习中难以泛化的问题，特别是在非静态环境中。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著减少适应新环境时的性能差距，且效果受环境复杂性和智能体目标异质性影响。

Conclusion: 因果知识转移框架为多智能体强化学习在动态环境中的知识共享提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI
collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别轻度认知障碍（MCI）和AD对延缓痴呆进展至关重要，但现有方法受数据选择偏差和变量复杂关系的干扰。

Method: 结合MRI、fMRI图像和LLM生成的文本数据，通过因果干预消除混杂因素，分类CN/MCI/AD。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD上表现优异，达到SOTA指标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对动态系统中高分辨率时序和数值推理的挑战，现有逻辑方法（如ASP）能力有限，需要新的扩展方法。

Method: 结合了线性时间Here-and-There逻辑和带约束的Here-and-There逻辑，构建了一个非单调时序推理框架。

Result: 提出了一种专为ASP设计的非单调时序推理方法，能够处理复杂动态系统的高分辨率需求。

Conclusion: 该工作为ASP范式下处理高分辨率动态系统奠定了逻辑基础。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric
resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like
Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Motivation: 现有本体匹配系统依赖手工规则或专用模型，适应性有限。KROMA旨在通过结合LLM和RAG技术，提升语义互操作性和匹配效率。

Method: KROMA采用基于双相似度的概念匹配和轻量级本体细化步骤，结合知识检索和上下文增强的LLM，减少通信开销。

Result: 实验表明，KROMA在多个基准数据集上优于传统系统和前沿的LLM方法，同时保持较低的通信开销。

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量糖尿病数据集获取困难的问题，推动AI在糖尿病管理中的应用。

Result: 同一算法在不同数据集上的预测结果差异显著，研究结果为开发稳健AI解决方案提供了建议。

Conclusion: Glucose-ML为糖尿病领域的AI研究提供了宝贵资源，并强调了数据选择对算法性能的重要性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of
state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access
to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of
robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,
and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly
available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -
2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous
glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected
from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support
researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes
datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with
data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood
glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through
this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction
across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML
collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different
prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings
from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust
AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct
links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and
openly provide our code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体运动模拟方法在运动逼真度上表现不佳，影响了工业任务中工人行为、安全和生产力的评估效果。

Method: G-AI-HMS利用大型语言模型将任务描述转化为运动感知语言，并通过计算机视觉验证AI生成的运动与真实人类动作的相似性。

Result: 在八项任务的案例研究中，AI增强的运动在多数场景中表现优于人工描述，显著降低了关节误差和时间错位。

Conclusion: G-AI-HMS显著提升了运动模拟的逼真度，为工业任务中的行为评估提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动解释无损评估（NDE）轮廓图，以提高桥梁维护效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥梁维护和安全至关重要，但NDE数据解释耗时且需专业知识，LLMs提供自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究设计了针对NDE轮廓图的提示词，评估了多个LLM模型在图像描述、缺陷识别和推荐方面的表现。

Result: 九种模型中四种表现优异，特别是ChatGPT-4和Claude 3.5 Sonnet能生成更有效的总结。

Conclusion: LLMs可显著提升桥梁维护效率与准确性，为基础设施管理提供创新支持。

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一个基于强化学习的自动CUDA优化框架，显著提升CUDA内核性能，并具有跨GPU架构的优异可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型对GPU计算资源的需求激增，急需自动化CUDA优化策略，而当前SOTA模型在CUDA优化上成功率低。

Method: 引入CUDA-L1，一个基于强化学习的自动化框架，通过速度提升奖励信号训练模型。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上平均提速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，且在不同GPU架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1证明强化学习可有效优化CUDA性能，无需人工干预，有望提升GPU效率并缓解资源压力。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Motivation: 填补对Transformer架构理论理解的空白，探索其物理工作原理。

Method: 从现代芯片的物理视角，在Fock空间构建基于开放量子系统的物理模型。

Result: 提出了支持Transformer架构的物理模型。

Conclusion: 物理模型为Transformer架构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多元对齐方法，通过引入DIVE数据集和实证研究，改进文本到图像（T2I）模型以更好地反映多样的人类价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型未能充分考虑多样的人类体验，导致系统与人类价值观不一致。论文旨在实现多元对齐，使AI能理解和适应多样且可能冲突的人类价值观。

Method: 1. 引入DIVE数据集，通过多元人口统计学背景的评估者提供反馈；2. 实证研究确认人口统计学是多样观点的关键代理；3. 探讨对齐T2I模型的策略。

Result: DIVE数据集捕捉了细微的安全感知差异，实证研究揭示了与传统评估不同的危害感知差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更公平和对齐的T2I系统提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在机器学习中使用CDF归一化的优势，特别是在KANs中，相比传统归一化方法（如均值标准差或固定范围缩放），CDF归一化能减少过拟合并提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据归一化方法（如均值标准差或固定范围缩放）在机器学习中广泛使用，但在某些情况下可能不够理想。作者希望通过引入金融领域常用的CDF归一化方法，展示其在机器学习中的潜力。

Method: 论文提出使用CDF归一化方法，将数据转换为近似均匀分布（[0,1]区间），并应用于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)中，替代传统的归一化方法。

Result: 实验表明，在KANs中使用CDF归一化可以显著提升预测性能（如Legendre-KAN的改进），同时减少过拟合。此外，HCR解释显示神经元权重为混合矩，支持局部联合分布建模和概率分布传播。

Conclusion: CDF归一化在机器学习中具有潜力，尤其是在KANs中，能够提升模型性能并提供更灵活的分布建模能力。

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to
CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate
also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

Result: 在六个时域数据集上验证，分类准确率高且训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多源数据的复杂系统，具有可扩展性和资源效率，适用于多个实际应用领域。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness
and adaptability are critical.

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和工程领域中的不确定性设计和分析提供了新的可能性，尤其是在最具挑战性的场景中。

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

Result: Soft-ECM在数值数据上与模糊聚类方法效果相当，并能有效处理混合数据和时间序列数据。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM扩展了信念函数聚类的应用范围，适用于复杂数据类型。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Motivation: 随着空域日益拥挤，现有复杂性指标难以捕捉超出简单飞机数量的细微操作驱动因素，因此需要一种新方法来实时评估ATCO任务需求。

Method: 采用基于注意力的图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过静态交通场景中的交互预测即将发布的指令数量，并通过系统性地移除飞机来推导每架飞机的任务需求评分。

Result: 该框架显著优于ATCO启发式方法，并比现有基线模型更可靠地估计场景复杂性。

Conclusion: 该工具能够将任务需求归因于特定飞机，为控制器培训和空域重新设计提供了新的分析和理解复杂性驱动因素的方法。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

Conclusion: 跨模态预训练是学习通用数据表示的有效工具，尤其在动态数据模态（如IMU信号）中。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient

TL;DR: Kaggle竞赛'Fake or Real'旨在解决AI安全威胁，要求区分正常和恶意修改的LLM输出，鼓励开发新技术或调整现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞赛基于欧洲航天局项目中发现的两个AI安全威胁：数据投毒和对大型语言模型的过度依赖，旨在填补相关研究空白。

Method: 参与者需开发新技术或调整现有方法，以区分正常LLM输出和恶意修改的输出。

Result: 竞赛结果未提及，但目标是推动解决这一未充分研究的问题。

Conclusion: 该竞赛为AI安全领域提供了重要挑战，鼓励创新方法以应对LLM的潜在威胁。

Abstract: The "Fake or Real" competition hosted on Kaggle
(\href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt}{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt})
is the second part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related
to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the
European Space Agency
(\href{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}).
The competition idea is based on two real-life AI security threats identified
within the project -- data poisoning and overreliance in Large Language Models.
The task is to distinguish between the proper output from LLM and the output
generated under malicious modification of the LLM. As this problem was not
extensively researched, participants are required to develop new techniques to
address this issue or adjust already existing ones to this problem's statement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过双收敛框架解释了LLMs如何通过上下文学习（ICL）从输入序列中学习新行为，无需参数更新，并揭示了其隐式偏向平滑表示的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何通过ICL从输入序列中学习新行为，并解释其背后的机制。

Method: 提出双收敛框架，分析隐藏表示在上下文和层间的收敛过程，证明其对平滑表示的隐式偏向。

Result: 理论解释了ICL的多个现象，如表示的几何结构、能量衰减及对高频噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为ICL机制提供了理论解释，并预测了其在高频噪声下的鲁棒性，为更广泛的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

*Beka Begiashvili,Carlos J. Fernandez-Candel,Matías Pérez Paredes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Acoustic Index的新型AI超声心动图参数，用于量化心脏功能障碍，结合了Koopman算子理论和混合神经网络，临床验证显示其具有高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声心动图参数（如EF和GLS）在早期检测心脏功能障碍时存在局限性，需要一种可重复、可解释且操作者独立的参数。

Method: 结合扩展动态模式分解（EDMD）和混合神经网络，提取超声心动图序列的时空动态特征，并通过注意力机制和流形学习融合临床数据，生成0到1的连续评分。

Result: 在736名患者的队列中，Acoustic Index的AUC为0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理信息驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，有望成为早期检测和监测心脏功能的工具，未来需进一步验证和扩展。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

### [35] [Time Series Forecastability Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13556)
*Rui Wang,Steven Klee,Alexis Roos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种指标（谱可预测性评分和最大李雅普诺夫指数）来量化时间序列的可预测性，帮助在模型开发前评估数据的固有特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型评估指标仅在模型开发后使用，无法提前评估数据的可预测性。本文旨在提供一种方法，帮助从业者在模型训练前了解数据的可预测性，从而优化资源分配和策略制定。

Method: 使用谱可预测性评分评估时间序列的频率成分强度和规律性，利用李雅普诺夫指数量化数据生成系统的混沌和稳定性。在合成数据和M5预测竞赛数据集上验证了这些指标的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，这两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与多种模型的实际预测性能有强相关性。

Conclusion: 通过提前评估数据的可预测性，从业者可以更高效地分配资源，并为难以预测的数据制定替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代更新注意力权重，提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，无需依赖自回归，在测试时根据输入难度动态调整计算，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在固定深度下表达能力受限，而自回归方法依赖外部化中间状态。SELF-Transformer旨在通过内部迭代提升表达能力，避免自回归的复杂性。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，动态调整测试时计算，无需生成中间标记。

Result: 在编码器基准测试中，准确率提升高达20%，且不增加参数量。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代恢复了迭代推理的表达能力，同时保持了纯编码器架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Motivation: 为Apple设备和服务的智能功能提供高效、高质量的多语言和多模态支持。

Method: 设备端模型采用KV-cache共享和2位量化训练；服务器端模型采用PT-MoE架构，结合并行计算和稀疏计算。

Result: 模型在公开基准测试和人工评估中表现优于同类开源模型。

Conclusion: Apple通过创新的模型架构和负责任的数据训练方法，提供了高效且隐私保护的智能模型。

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a
3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse
computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality
with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models
are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional
languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public
benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model
match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,
constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to
integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements
in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with
safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as
our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private

TL;DR: PLUS框架通过生成用户偏好摘要，实现个性化奖励模型，提升LLM对不同用户的响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法无法区分用户差异，PLUS旨在通过用户摘要实现个性化响应。

Method: PLUS利用强化学习训练用户摘要模型，并动态更新奖励模型，形成在线协同适应循环。

Result: PLUS生成的摘要能有效捕捉用户偏好，适应新用户和多样话题，且可迁移至GPT-4等模型。

Conclusion: PLUS提供透明、可解释的用户摘要，增强LLM对齐的用户控制和个性化能力。

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了针对匹配市场的两种新型离线策略评估（OPE）估计器DiPS和DPR，解决了传统方法在双向用户交互中的方差和奖励稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场中的双向用户交互和大规模特性导致传统OPE方法不可靠，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 结合直接法（DM）、逆倾向得分（IPS）和双重稳健（DR）估计器，并引入中间标签以优化偏差-方差控制。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，DiPS和DPR在偏差和方差控制上优于传统方法，并能扩展到离线策略学习。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在匹配市场的离线评估和学习任务中表现优越，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer的Tri-GFN框架，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略提升图聚类的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GCN在大规模复杂图数据中的过平滑和过压缩问题，以及Graph Transformer在异构图数据中的性能限制。

Method: 结合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略优化全局与局部信息的区分和一致性。

Result: 在ACM、Reuters和USPS数据集上分别提升0.87%、14.14%和7.58%的准确率。

Conclusion: Tri-GFN框架在自动新闻分类和主题检索等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

Result: 在非IID数据分布下，FedSkipTwin减少通信12-15.5%，模型精度提升0.5%。

Conclusion: 预测引导的跳过策略在带宽受限的边缘环境中是实用且有效的。

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection:
enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three
months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping
financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events

practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study
introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against
the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature
window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months
in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming
existing baselines.

Result: 改进方法显著提升了PI-GNNs在高密度图问题中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模糊逻辑和二值化神经网络的策略，可以有效解决PI-GNNs在高密度图中的性能问题。

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Motivation: 探索MOBO在分子设计中的实际优势，尤其是与标量化方法相比。

Method: 使用基于Pareto的MOBO策略（EHVI）与固定权重标量化基线（EI）进行对比，控制实验条件一致。

Result: EHVI在Pareto前沿覆盖、收敛速度和化学多样性上均优于EI。

Conclusion: Pareto感知的获取策略在分子优化中具有实际优势，尤其是在预算有限时。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework
for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical
advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

Conclusion: AST方法通过结合标记化和注意力机制，实现了高效且可扩展的可变形体交互模拟，并贡献了一个新的大规模数据集。

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component
failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency
decision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework
for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an
improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency
is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to
the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature
fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode
subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and
Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,
and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are
highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based
Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for

Motivation: 对抗训练在增强模型对抗攻击鲁棒性方面表现良好，但其在音频分类中面对数据分布显著变化时的泛化能力影响尚不明确。

Method: 研究采用两种对抗训练策略（输出空间攻击和嵌入空间攻击），并在两种模型架构（ConvNeXt和AudioProtoPNet）上进行评估，使用鸟类声音分类基准测试。

Result: 对抗训练（尤其是输出空间攻击）显著提升了模型在干净测试数据上的性能（平均提升10.5%），并增强了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗训练在音频分类中具有潜力，可同时提升对强分布变化和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Conclusion: SamGoG能有效解决图分类中的不平衡问题，且兼容多种GNN模型，性能优越。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in

impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often

However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的因果过程框架（Causal Process framework），用于表示动态因果结构的假设，并实现了Causal Process Model。通过将Transformer的注意力机制与强化学习结合，从视觉观察中推断可解释的因果过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数神经因果模型假设静态因果图，忽略了因果交互的动态性。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出动态因果结构的表示方法。

Method: 引入Causal Process框架，并实现Causal Process Model。将Transformer的注意力机制与强化学习结合，通过RL代理构建动态因果图假设。

Result: 在强化学习环境中，该方法在因果表示学习和代理性能上优于现有方法，并能恢复动态因果过程的图结构。

Conclusion: Causal Process框架为动态因果结构提供了新的理论基础，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理的模拟计算成本高，难以全面探索蛋白质构象空间。

Method: 提出MoDyGAN框架，包含生成器和双判别器，将3D蛋白质结构转化为2D矩阵，利用GAN生成新构象。

Result: 在三种刚性蛋白上生成合理构象，并在十丙氨酸案例中与SMD模拟轨迹一致。

Conclusion: MoDyGAN为生物分子模拟提供高效构象采样方法，并有望扩展到其他复杂3D结构。

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Result: 在真实和合成网络中验证，新方法显著优于六种基线模型，证明了可控性度量的重要性。

Conclusion: 平均可控性可作为额外指标，有效提升图机器学习模型在稀疏不平衡数据中的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Conclusion: 模型架构对SC协调性能至关重要，图方法特别适合大规模多站点SC研究中的结构感知和领域泛化协调。

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列预测中对长短期依赖赋予相同权重并不理想，需要更灵活的权重分配机制。

Method: 提出动态加权机制ParallelTime Weighter，基于输入和模型知识计算长短期依赖的权重，并设计ParallelTime架构实现该机制。

Result: ParallelTime在多个基准测试中表现优异，具有鲁棒性、低计算量、少参数需求，并能适应更长的预测范围。

Conclusion: ParallelTime为时间序列预测中的并行Attention-Mamba架构提供了有前景的发展方向。

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The
implementation is readily available at:

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究发现基于对偶公式的动态规划方法在寻找静态CVaR最优策略时会失败，但原因不明。本文旨在揭示这一问题的根源。

Method: 通过将重点从策略优化转移到策略评估，提出了两个最小化问题框架，并引入风险分配一致性约束。

Result: 发现约束交集为空是导致评估错误的根源，并证明了在对偶CVaR分解中寻找单一最优策略存在根本性限制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CVaR评估问题的本质，并指出对偶CVaR分解方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 实验表明，DONUT比传统拟合方法效率提高200倍以上。

Conclusion: DONUT为X射线科学中的实时分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than
conventional fitting methods.

Method: 受生物大脑多时间尺度动态的启发，提出了一种不确定性调节增益动态机制，模拟两时间尺度优化器。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR基准测试中，该机制有效减少了稳定性缺口。

Conclusion: 不确定性调节增益动态不仅解决了稳定性缺口问题，还提供了对生物神经调节机制的模拟，为持续学习性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Conclusion: Pb-MORL展示了在复杂现实系统中应用的潜力，提供了一种更直观且高效的多目标优化方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents
often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as
domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

Result: KANs 在原始不平衡数据上表现优于 MLPs，但传统不平衡策略会显著降低其性能。MLPs 结合不平衡技术可达到与 KANs 相当的效果，且资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: KANs 适用于资源充足的原始不平衡数据场景，但其性能与资源消耗的权衡及与传统策略的不兼容性限制了实际应用。未来需优化 KANs 的架构和计算效率。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering

low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为ALP的少样本自适应语言提示方法，利用多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro）检测钓鱼网页，显著提升了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击是严重的网络安全威胁，需要自适应检测技术。

Method: ALP通过结构化语义推理，指导大语言模型分析文本欺骗性，包括分解语言模式、检测紧迫性线索和识别操纵性措辞，并结合文本、视觉和URL分析。

Result: 实验显示ALP显著提升了钓鱼检测准确率，F1分数达到0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP为基于语言的钓鱼检测系统提供了更鲁棒、可解释和自适应的基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

*Keito Inoshita,Rushia Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaGen是一个基于大型语言模型的多阶段人格条件框架，用于生成情感丰富的文本，以解决情感识别领域高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感表达具有主观性，受个体特质、社会文化背景和情境影响，导致大规模通用数据收集困难。

Method: 通过结合人口属性、社会文化背景和详细情境构建虚拟人格，指导情感表达生成。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaGen在生成多样、连贯且具有区分性的情感表达方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaGen可作为增强或替代真实情感数据集的强大工具。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息到预训练LLMs中，显著提升了AMR到文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理AMR等结构化输入时，常忽略关键结构信息或与标准LLMs不兼容，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: SAFT通过计算方向敏感的位置编码（基于磁拉普拉斯变换的AMR），并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间中，无需改变模型架构。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，且性能提升与图复杂度正相关。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且高效的途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的新方法，利用NLP技术和GBAD算法检测假新闻，并在COVID-19相关新闻数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在数字世界中快速传播，成为一个重要问题，需要新的方法来解决。

Method: 使用NLP将新闻文章转换为图结构，并应用基于MDL的GBAD算法进行图挖掘，以发现异常模式。

Result: 该方法能够识别数据集中的规范模式，并检测偏离这些模式的异常模式。

Conclusion: 基于图的方法在处理复杂上下文数据时表现优异，为假新闻检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

TL;DR: PARAM-1是一个专注于印度语言多样性的2.9B参数语言模型，通过公平的数据分配、适应印度形态的tokenizer和文化对齐的评估基准，实现了在印度多语言环境中的高效表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）以英语为中心，忽视了印度等多语言地区的需求，导致结构性的语言代表性不足。

Method: PARAM-1采用双语（印地语和英语）数据集训练，注重公平的语料分配、适应印度形态的tokenizer和文化对齐的评估基准。

Result: PARAM-1在印度中心应用中表现出色，既能作为通用模型，也能作为印度多语言任务的基准。

Conclusion: PARAM-1为公平的基础模型设计提供了蓝图，强调了在预训练阶段嵌入多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

Motivation: 改进客户评论分析，提取更连贯且可解释的主题，同时捕捉情感信息，以更好地理解客户关注点对业务的影响。

Method: 利用大型语言模型提取意见单元（包含相关文本和情感评分），并改进主题建模流程。

Result: 主题建模性能提升，生成连贯且可解释的主题，并能预测星级评分。

Conclusion: 该方法在客户评论分析中表现优越，能有效结合主题和情感信息，为业务决策提供支持。

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

TL;DR: Babel框架通过单语语料库提升神经机器翻译的风格保真度，无需平行语料库或修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经机器翻译方法在风格保真度上的不足，尤其是对平行语料库的依赖问题。

Method: Babel包含风格检测器和扩散式风格应用器，前者识别风格差异，后者修正风格不一致性。

Result: 实验显示Babel在风格不一致性检测上精度达88.21%，风格保真度提升150%，语义相似度保持0.92。

Conclusion: Babel有效提升翻译的风格保真度且不影响语义和流畅性，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型（LLM）的生成语言，通过修改单个SAE特征实现高达90%的语言转换成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多语言大模型中零样本设置下无法确定性控制生成语言的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的SAE分析Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B的残差流，识别与目标语言（中、日、西、法）显著相关的特征，并通过修改单个特征实现语言控制。

Result: 在FastText语言分类中达到90%的成功率，同时保持LaBSE语义相似性。语言控制在模型中后期层效果最佳。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征控制是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Result: 在多个问答基准数据集和实际金融用例中显著提升模型表现。

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，能显著提高语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），这可能带来新的安全漏洞，因此提出验证这一可能性并探索其影响。

Method: 设计了PSA方法，通过合成攻击或防御导向的论文内容构建对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子部分中填充有害查询作为对抗性载荷。

Result: 实验显示PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet上达到97%的攻击成功率，在Deepseek-R1上达到98%，并揭示了不同模型对攻击或防御导向论文的相反漏洞倾向。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLMs的新漏洞，为对抗性方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Conclusion: 研究为句法结构的神经计算实现提供了理论框架，并展示了Merge操作与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM生成文本与人类文本在语言特征上的差异，以更深入理解机器生成文本的特点。

Method: 选择8个领域和11种LLM的文本数据集，计算句法、语义等语言特征，结合统计分析和风格嵌入测试。

Result: 人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样；风格多样性上人类更高，新模型生成文本趋于同质化。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本在语言特征上与人类存在差异，且新模型生成文本风格趋同。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual

multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

Conclusion: CU-ICU是一种高效、可扩展的临床决策支持解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有级联方法因依赖精确文本匹配而无法可靠评估自由形式输出的问题。

Method: 提出Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC)，通过识别弱模型输出的代表性答案并评估语义对齐，决定是否升级到强模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，平均减少28.81%的API成本，并在特定基准中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成框架，显著提升了级联方法的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话中，长上下文导致的计算和内存问题限制了大型语言模型的响应速度和效率，现有方法无法适应动态对话模式。

Result: 实验表明，LoopServe在多种长上下文对话任务中显著加速推理并优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LoopServe通过自适应优化有效解决了多轮对话中的计算和内存挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在群组推荐系统中的表现，比较其推荐和解释与标准聚合策略的差异，以提升透明性和解释性。

Method: 通过比较LLM生成的推荐和解释与Additive Utilitarian (ADD)聚合策略的结果，分析群组结构和额外标准的影响。

Result: LLM推荐与ADD相似，解释多涉及评分平均。群组结构不影响推荐，但LLMs常引入额外标准。解释的透明性和一致性不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在群组推荐系统中表现类似ADD，但解释透明性不足，需改进以提升实用性和可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

Conclusion: 司法身份在法律结果中起可测量作用，支持法律现实主义。数据与代码将公开。

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过参数高效微调技术（LoRA和软提示调优）减少大型语言模型（LLMs）对LGBTQIA+群体的偏见，发现LoRA能显著降低偏见分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在训练数据中常带有性别和性取向偏见，导致输出对LGBTQIA+用户不友好，因此需要减少此类偏见。

Method: 使用WinoQueer基准评估三种开源LLMs的偏见，并比较LoRA和软提示调优两种参数高效微调技术。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）在QueerNews语料上微调后，偏见分数降低多达50分，中立性从0%提升至36%；软提示调优效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以极低计算成本显著提升公平性，建议推广社区参与的高效微调方法，并扩大LGBTQIA+语料库和评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Motivation: 探索提示敏感性如何被利用生成不适当内容，特别是在VLMs中。

Method: 分析三个关键因素对越狱的影响：详细视觉信息、对抗样本和积极开头短语；提出一种利用内部层间跳跃连接的框架。

Result: 每个因素都能独立触发越狱，少量上下文示例即可导致不适当输出；跳跃连接框架显著提高成功率。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态环境中存在复杂脆弱性，即使是看似无害的内容（如表情包）也可能引发有害输出。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和最新方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+是一种高效的短文本聚类方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法在提取科学文章关键概念上表现优越，模型微调是关键。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

Result: LLM生成的故事虽然不可预测，但未能平衡惊喜与公平游戏，导致质量较差。

Conclusion: 概率框架有效揭示了LLM生成故事的不足，强调了平衡惊喜与公平游戏的重要性。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

Motivation: 网络安全NER领域缺乏标准化标签，导致数据集难以结合使用，研究旨在通过标签统一提高数据资源的可用性。

Method: 采用粗粒度标签统一方法，使用BiLSTM模型进行跨数据集评估，并提出多头模型和基于图的迁移模型。

Result: 统一数据集训练的模型泛化能力差，多头模型仅带来边际改进，基于图的迁移模型相比BERT-base-NER无显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 标签统一在网络安全NER中效果有限，未来研究需探索更有效的模型架构或方法。

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared
BERT-base-NER.

*Carlos Mena,Pol Serra,Jacobo Romero,Abir Messaoudi,Jose Giraldo,Carme Armentano-Oller,Rodolfo Zevallos,Ivan Meza,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据、拼接单语音频和利用真实语码转换数据来提升加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语语码转换的自动语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在自动语音识别（ASR）中因训练数据稀缺和语言相似性而面临挑战，尤其是在多语言社会中。缺乏专门的CS数据集限制了ASR性能。

Method: 研究采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用真实CS数据与语言标记。基于加泰罗尼亚语音语料库提取CS数据，并微调OpenAI的Whisper模型。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据与主导语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据与语言标记的结合，可以有效提升加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语CS的ASR性能。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从情境判断测试（SJTs）中提取相关特征的新方法，以解决传统人工评分在规模化应用中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术项目日益重视个人和专业技能的重要性，但传统SJTs依赖人工评分，难以规模化。现有NLP评分系统因构念效度问题效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种基于LLMs的新方法，从SJTs的开放回答中提取构念相关特征，并以Casper SJT为例验证其有效性。

Result: 研究表明该方法为个人和专业技能的自动化评分奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMs在SJTs自动化评分中具有潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分布外文本上表现不佳，且解决方案孤立。本文旨在通过整合数据集和改进模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 整合了12个政治倾向分类数据集，并扩展了18个现有数据集以创建新的政治性分类数据集。采用留一法和留出法进行基准测试，评估和改进模型。

Result: 通过基准测试，展示了改进后模型在泛化能力上的提升。

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据集和改进模型能有效提升政治文本分类的泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，当前和近未来的AI说服力主要来自后训练和提示方法，而非个性化或模型规模扩大，但这些方法会降低事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估对话AI对人类信念的潜在影响，特别是其说服力和事实准确性。

Method: 通过三个大规模实验（N=76,977），测试19个LLM在707个政治议题上的说服力，并检查466,769个生成声明的事实准确性。

Result: 后训练和提示方法显著提升说服力（分别达51%和27%），但会降低事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力提升更多依赖于技术方法，而非模型规模或个性化，但需权衡说服力与事实准确性。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP任务中表现出位置偏差（如首因效应），影响准确性，需研究其影响及利用方法。

Method: 通过语义相似度重排MCQA选项，利用首因效应提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了MCQA任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 偏差既是挑战也是机会，为偏差感知模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的任务生成方法，通过从KG原语合成任务，训练语言模型以获取领域专业知识，并在医学领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在跨领域泛化中表现良好，但缺乏深度领域专业知识。论文旨在通过KG的层次结构，从简单概念组合为复杂概念，实现领域超级智能。

Method: 使用KG原语生成任务，构建KG驱动的课程，并微调语言模型（如QwQ-32B）以获取领域专业知识。

Result: QwQ-Med-3模型在医学领域显著优于现有推理模型，并在ICD-Bench评估中表现出色。

Conclusion: 论文展示了通过组合领域特定超级智能代理实现通用人工智能（AGI）的潜力，并验证了KG驱动的任务生成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的阿拉伯语语音和文本处理方法，并基于FastConformer架构训练了两个新模型，分别针对现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）和古典阿拉伯语（CA），取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统的发展面临语言复杂性和资源有限的挑战，尤其是对语言变体的关注不足。

Method: 提出通用方法，基于FastConformer架构训练两个模型：一个针对MSA，另一个统一处理MSA和CA。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能，统一模型在CA上实现带音标的SOTA准确率，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型和训练方法以促进可复现性，填补了阿拉伯语ASR领域的空白。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在捕捉人类移动轨迹的时空依赖性和计算效率上的不足。

Method: 将轨迹分段为每日令牌，利用分层注意力和预计算提示嵌入增强LLM的推理能力，同时冻结LLM主干以提高效率。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，准确率提升2.4%，周末表现提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为人类移动预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 使用CPC计算评估标准权重，构建加权决策矩阵，选择基线模型（如ALBERT、LSTM等），并在三个社交媒体数据集上验证。

Result: 排除时间因素时ALBERT表现最佳；考虑时间消耗时无单一模型始终最优。

Conclusion: CPC-CMS框架可推广至其他分类应用领域。

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and

tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

Result: 在指称游戏和医疗领域医患对话实验中，CRSA表现出更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识的语言代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考历史记录的方式生成临床进展记录，填补了电子健康记录中进展记录的缺失，并提高了时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中进展记录严重不足，影响患者纵向叙事完整性，需要一种方法填补这一空白。

Method: DENSE系统结合细粒度分类和时间对齐机制，利用大型语言模型生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展记录。

Result: 生成的记录在时间对齐比例上优于原始记录（1.089），支持下游任务如总结和预测建模。

Conclusion: DENSE为临床环境中的记录合成提供了可扩展的解决方案，增强了叙事的连贯性。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLABA track评估了语言模型在将生物医学文献改写为通俗语言方面的表现，发现LLM在准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性和自动评估工具上仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的专业性使其难以被患者和护理人员理解，语言模型虽有潜力改写为通俗语言，但需严格评估以避免潜在危害。

Method: 通过PLABA竞赛（Task 1和Task 2）评估模型改写摘要和替换专业术语的能力，结合专业人工评估和自动参考指标。

Result: Task 1中，顶级模型在准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但简洁性不足；Task 2中，LLM在生成替换术语时表现良好，但识别和分类术语仍有困难。自动评估工具与人工评估相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM在生物医学文献通俗化方面有潜力，但需改进简洁性和自动评估工具。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EDNIG的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强。它基于U-Net架构，结合了亮度图和多尺度特征提取模块，并通过GAN框架优化，取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强在现实应用中具有重要意义，但现有方法在处理多样光照条件时表现不足。EDNIG旨在通过引入亮度指导和多尺度特征提取，提升增强效果。

Method: EDNIG基于U-Net架构，结合亮度图（来自BCP）作为指导输入，并引入SPP模块提取多尺度特征。使用Swish激活函数，并在GAN框架下优化。

Result: 实验表明，EDNIG在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，同时模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG是一种高效的低光图像增强方法，适合实际应用。代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [120] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在复杂视觉任务中表现优异，但在非局部视觉推理任务中表现不佳，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的能力，揭示其核心视觉推理能力的不足。

Method: 设计了三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、平滑视觉搜索），测试主流VLMs的表现。

Result: 主流模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Vision 3.7、GPT-o4-mini）在这些任务中表现不佳，仅略高于随机准确率。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs在视觉敏锐度上有进步，但其核心视觉推理能力仍不足。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而强化学习方法GRPO在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于监督微调（SFT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLMs的空间推理能力，并解决传统方法（如SFT）在泛化性和鲁棒性上的不足。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提高了空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估中表现优于SFT，且在分布外（OOD）条件下更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强化学习和结构化提示能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化行为，GRPO在鲁棒性和泛化性上优于传统方法。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测数据集因类别有限和标注成本高，难以扩展至开放世界场景，而2D视觉语言模型具有丰富的语义理解和开放词汇能力。

Method: 结合2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，利用SAM分割并通过相机几何和伪深度反投影到3D，采用DBSCAN聚类和旋转卡尺进行几何推理。

Result: 在LiDAR和RGB-D输入下均表现出色，无需训练且支持开放词汇检测。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力，代码开源。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练算法在多模态和多任务场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

TL;DR: Butter是一种新型目标检测框架，通过增强分层特征表示提升检测鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和计算效率之间难以平衡，影响检测精度。

Method: Butter引入两个创新组件：FAFCE（频率自适应特征一致性增强）和PHFFNet（渐进分层特征融合网络）。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，Butter显著提升了检测精度并降低了模型复杂度。

Conclusion: Butter在分层特征优化和集成方面提供了先进方法，实现了精度、部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving

Motivation: 现有密集文本标注方法虽然召回率高，但计算成本高且会遗漏关键视觉信息（如场景文本）。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，动态路由到ASR、OCR或视觉索引，减少模态搜索数量。

Result: 在180万视频片段上测试，计算开销降低41%，召回率达到60.9%，平均每查询仅使用1.78种模态。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和样本外性能具有重要价值，硬编码融合策略值得未来研究关注。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Conclusion: 为构建更安全、负责任的生成模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Conclusion: 通过利用二进制占用数据，该框架为低成本高效的3D语义占用预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以缓解时间序列预测中的初始步发散问题。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上，InSyn显著优于现有基线模型，尤其在拥挤场景中表现突出。SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低了约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略的结合有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，特别是在高密度场景中，为智能应用提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AortaDiff是一种基于扩散的框架，直接从CT/MRI体积生成平滑的主动脉表面，解决了现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预的问题，适用于CFD分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的3D主动脉构建对临床诊断和CFD模拟至关重要，但现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预，且生成的网格几何一致性差。

Method: AortaDiff采用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑的3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff是一种端到端、低依赖标注数据的实用解决方案，适用于心血管研究。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

TL;DR: COREVQA是一个新的视觉语言模型基准测试，专注于拥挤场景中的视觉蕴含推理，结果显示现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少测试模型在视觉蕴含任务（如基于图像接受或反驳假设）上的能力。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成生成的真/假陈述对，图像来自CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型准确率也低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型在拥挤场景的视觉蕴含推理能力存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

TL;DR: IConMark是一种新型的语义水印方法，通过嵌入可解释的概念到AI生成图像中，提高水印的鲁棒性和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像对防止错误信息和确保数字真实性至关重要。传统水印技术易受对抗攻击，需要更鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Method: IConMark通过嵌入有意义的语义属性（而非噪声或扰动）实现水印，使其对人类可解释且抗对抗攻击。还结合了StegaStamp和TrustMark（IConMark+SS和IConMark+TM）以增强鲁棒性。

Result: IConMark及其变体在检测准确性和图像质量上优于基线方法，AUROC分数分别提高了10.8%、14.5%和15.9%。

Conclusion: IConMark为可解释水印技术提供了有效解决方案，兼具鲁棒性和人类可读性，可与其他水印技术结合以进一步增强性能。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

TL;DR: AI系统通过多模型深度学习技术，显著提高了肩部骨折的检测准确率，达到95.5%，适用于临床快速筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肩部骨折在急诊和高流量临床环境中常被漏诊，AI工具可提供早期检测支持。

Method: 使用10,000张标注肩部X光片，结合Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet和RF-DETR等多模型，并采用Soft-NMS、WBF和NMW融合等集成技术。

Result: NMW集成模型准确率达95.5%，F1分数0.9610，优于单一模型。

Conclusion: 基于集成的AI系统能高准确率检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断流程，但仅限于二元骨折检测。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因环境变化导致考古遗址消失的问题，利用AI技术提高遗址识别效率。

Method: 使用CORONA卫星图像重新训练基于Bing的卷积网络模型，应用于伊拉克阿布格莱布地区。

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU超过85%，总体准确率90%），发现四个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI技术与CORONA图像结合是发现消失考古遗址的有效方法，具有重要研究意义。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以准确建模人类驾驶行为的复杂时空依赖性和不可预测性，影响了人机共驾系统的安全性和交互效率。

Method: CaSTFormer提出了一种新颖的互易移位融合（RSF）机制、因果模式提取（CPE）模块和特征合成网络（FSN），以消除虚假相关性并合成纯净的时空推理。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上，CaSTFormer实现了最先进的性能，有效捕捉了复杂的因果时空依赖关系。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer显著提升了驾驶意图预测的准确性和透明度，为高级自动驾驶奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于摄影测量点云不确定性量化的框架，填补了多视图立体（MVS）阶段不确定性估计的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄影测量点云的准确性高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过结合SfM和MVS阶段，提出了一种自校准方法，利用可靠的多视图点回归视差不确定性。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，该方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为摄影测量过程提供了稳健且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream

detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Motivation: 随着2D材料在纳米电子学中的广泛应用，需要高效的电气表征技术，而传统的C-AFM方法因扫描速度慢难以满足大规模生产需求。

Method: 通过深度学习模型SparseC-AFM，从稀疏的C-AFM扫描数据中重建导电性图，替代传统的高像素密度扫描。

Result: SparseC-AFM将数据采集时间减少了11倍以上，且重建结果与高分辨率扫描数据具有相似的电气特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI辅助的2D材料表征从实验室研究向工业制造的转化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that

By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our

integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline

<details>

Motivation: 现实应用中的领域特定细节和细粒度语义难以通过合成重放方法捕捉，导致样本对齐不佳，影响微调和知识保留。

Method: 采用LoRA增强的合成重放框架，分两阶段基于置信度选择样本：先选择真实任务数据微调LoRA，再生成并选择合成样本用于蒸馏。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优于现有合成重放技术，实现了塑性、稳定性和零样本能力的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA适配生成器，显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架（\ours），用于从未配对数据中学习图像去模糊，通过生成纹理先验知识恢复模糊图像的纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取大量真实的模糊-清晰图像对困难且昂贵，从未配对数据中学习盲图像去模糊更具实用性和前景。现有方法依赖对抗学习，忽略了真实世界模糊模式的复杂性和不可预测性。

Method: 提出Texture Prior Encoder（TPE）和Texture Transfer Transformer层（TTformer），利用扩散模型生成纹理先验知识，并通过Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention（FM-MSA）自适应去除空间变化的模糊。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，\ours表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: \ours为无监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案，并通过生成纹理先验知识有效恢复图像细节。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的爆发低分辨率图像超分辨率方法，通过随机采样器和知识蒸馏提高效率，显著减少运行时间并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有爆发超分辨率方法以确定性方式训练，导致模糊的超分辨率图像，影响感知质量。本文旨在通过扩散模型重建清晰且高保真的超分辨率图像。

Method: 使用随机采样器结合高阶ODE以及通过知识蒸馏实现一步扩散，提高扩散模型的效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能将运行时间减少至基线的1.6%，同时保持基于图像失真和感知质量的超分辨率效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和图像质量之间取得了平衡，为爆发超分辨率任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: CoTasks框架通过分解视频问题为四个实体级基础任务，显著提升了视频大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体追踪、时空关系提取等四个基础任务，并嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B的推理性能分别提升3.3和17.4分。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合光流和纹理信息的方法FoELS，用于从移动相机视角分离静态和动态物体，解决了复杂场景中的检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖光流，难以在复杂结构化场景中检测动态物体，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: FoELS通过计算光流的扩展焦点（FoE）并融合纹理信息，生成运动概率，结合分割先验估计最终动态概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS能有效处理复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EPSilon提出了一种高效的混合3D头像生成方法，通过空射线和空区间省略策略减少计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合表示方法因使用SMPL皮肤权重变形导致推理速度慢，EPSilon旨在通过高效点采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: 提出空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）两种策略，减少无效采样点，优化训练和推理效率。

Result: EPSilon仅使用3.9%的采样点，推理速度提升约20倍，训练收敛速度提升4倍，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合3D头像生成的效率，为实时应用提供了可能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Conclusion: TriPro-ReID框架和EvReID数据集为未来研究提供了数据和基准支持。

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet为图像恢复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，兼具全局建模能力和低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

TL;DR: MaskHOI是一个基于掩码自编码器（MAE）的预训练框架，用于提升3D手-物体交互（HOI）中的姿态估计，通过区域特定掩码分配和掩码SDF学习解决几何模糊和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目RGB输入在3D手-物体交互任务中因几何模糊和严重遮挡导致的姿态估计困难。

Method: 提出MaskHOI框架，包括区域特定掩码分配（区分手和物体的掩码比例）和骨架驱动的手掩码引导，以及掩码SDF驱动的多模态学习机制。

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过掩码策略和多模态学习有效提升了姿态估计的几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统因成本和部署差异导致传感器配置异构，这给特征融合和感知可靠性带来挑战。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，结合动态融合类型的学习策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，并在CVPR 2025 DriveX挑战赛中取得第一名。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需定制参数即可实现高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高效、高精度的视觉测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Conclusion: 新准度量为MOT算法的性能评估提供了更灵活的工具，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Result: 通过人类和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，并发布了P4I数据集。

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，增强了生成图像的信息捕捉能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Conclusion: StyleGAN的技术能力不仅具有学术价值，还引发了对其可能被滥用于伪造身份的伦理担忧。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本类增量学习中数据有限和灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 使用冻结的扩散模型提取多尺度特征，结合潜在重放和特征蒸馏。

Result: 在CUB-200、miniImageNet和CIFAR-100上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过冻结模型和最小化训练组件实现了高效且性能优越的增量学习。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

TL;DR: EVS是一种无需训练的封装视频合成器，结合T2I和T2V模型，提升生成视频的视觉质量和运动平滑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成高质量视频时存在画面闪烁和帧间不一致的问题。

Method: 利用预训练的T2I模型优化低质量视频帧，同时结合T2V模型确保运动一致性。

Result: 实验证明EVS在视觉质量和运动平滑性上优于现有方法，推理速度提升1.6x-4.5x。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了视频生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

*Mingyang Yu,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的光谱扩散先验（SDP）和光谱先验注入模块（SPIM），用于提升高光谱图像（HSI）重建的高频细节恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在高光谱图像重建中难以准确捕捉高频细节，需改进。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习光谱扩散先验（SDP），并结合动态指导的光谱先验注入模块（SPIM）。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet方法上，性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM有效提升了HSI重建的高频细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于排列熵（PE）的新型特征提取方法，结合HOG和LBP，用于图像分类，展示了轻量级且可解释的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分类中，当需要优先考虑可解释性和计算效率时，特征工程仍然至关重要。本文旨在探索一种基于PE的轻量级方法，替代复杂的深度学习模型。

Method: 扩展PE至二维图像，结合HOG和LBP提取多尺度、多方向的特征，训练SVM分类器。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，展示了与深度学习模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: PE与HOG和LBP的结合为图像分类提供了轻量级、可解释且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要通过重述问题解决模糊性，忽略了用户反馈的交互性。缺乏评估交互澄清能力的基准，且模型倾向于回答而非提问。

Method: 引入ClearVQA基准，针对VQA中的三类常见模糊性，涵盖多种场景。

Result: ClearVQA基准填补了交互澄清能力评估的空白。

Conclusion: ClearVQA为视觉语言模型的交互澄清能力提供了评估工具，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 自动化流程显著提升了训练数据的规模和质量，推动了图像编辑助手的研究，并通过开源数据集和模型促进领域发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Motivation: 在半监督学习和无监督域适应中，聚类假设已被证明对有限监督下的学习有益。然而，现有方法通常隐式地利用这一假设，本文旨在通过显式引入可微分聚类模块来改进性能。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的训练策略，显式地结合了可微分聚类模块，并利用监督数据计算聚类中心。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在半监督学习和无监督域适应中表现优异，尤其在低监督情况下，既能作为独立模型，也能作为现有方法的正则化器。

Conclusion: 显式引入可微分聚类模块是一种简单有效的策略，能够显著提升半监督学习和无监督域适应的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Conclusion: LoFNO能够提升血流数据的时空分辨率，为脑血管诊断提供更精确的工具。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最先进水平，展示了盲脸恢复的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore通过动态调整策略，显著提升了盲脸恢复的保真度和细节生成能力。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Motivation: 现有单目3D语义场景补全方法在真实交通场景中因遮挡和视野限制表现不佳，需要一种能扩展感知范围的方法。

Method: 提出CF-SSC框架，结合位姿和深度建立3D对应关系，实现过去、当前和预测未来帧的几何一致性融合，显式建模时空关系。

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模和未来帧预测，有效解决了单目3D语义场景补全的局限性，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态感知在资源受限环境中的高模型复杂度、单向模态对齐和缺失数据鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 结合Mamba模型处理时间序列数据，使用GRAM矩阵优化模态对齐，引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，性能提升显著且参数训练量极少。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA在资源受限环境中实现了高效且鲁棒的多模态感知。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性预训练策略，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the

Motivation: 解决单目3D车道检测因缺乏显式空间信息而面临的挑战，避免依赖昂贵传感器或大规模深度数据收集。

Method: 提出双路径框架，结合自监督深度网络生成点云表示，分别从鸟瞰图和前视图提取空间和语义信息，使用3D车道锚点采样特征并推断几何。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane在无需标定或深度数据的情况下实现了高效3D车道检测，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate

TL;DR: PositionIC是一个统一框架，通过位置和身份一致性实现多主题图像定制，解决了现有方法在细粒度空间控制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题驱动的图像定制方法在保真度上取得了进展，但缺乏细粒度的实体级空间控制，限制了实际应用。

Method: 构建了一个可扩展的合成管道，采用双向生成范式消除主题漂移，并设计轻量级位置调制层以解耦空间嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，PositionIC在图像定制任务中实现了精确的空间控制和高一致性。

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景下的可控高保真图像定制提供了可能，并将公开发布以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何处理内部知识与外部信息冲突，发现特定注意力头控制冲突，并可通过修改这些头引导模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理内部参数知识与外部信息冲突时产生的幻觉和不可靠响应问题。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位控制冲突的注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 发现特定注意力头控制冲突，修改这些头可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入，且注意力定位优于梯度方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为改进模型可靠性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

TL;DR: PCR-GS是一种无需COLMAP的3D高斯泼溅技术，通过相机姿态共正则化提升复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂相机轨迹场景中表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和3D建模的局部最优问题。

Method: 提出两种正则化方法：特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频正则化，分别利用语义对齐和高频细节优化相机姿态。

Result: 在多个真实场景实验中，PCR-GS显著提升了复杂相机轨迹下的3D建模效果。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过共正则化技术有效解决了复杂相机轨迹场景中的3D建模和姿态估计问题。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用DepthAnything生成深度先验的方法，结合LiDAR数据提升3D目标检测性能，通过双路径RoI特征提取和双向门控融合模块优化检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LiDAR数据在3D目标检测中特征表达能力有限，尤其是反射率属性区分能力弱，而视觉基础模型（如DepthAnything）提供的深度先验未被充分利用。

Method: 1. 使用DepthAnything从RGB图像预测深度先验，与LiDAR属性融合；2. 设计点级特征提取模块；3. 采用双路径RoI特征提取框架（体素分支和点分支）；4. 引入双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升，验证了视觉基础模型先验对LiDAR检测的价值。

Conclusion: 结合视觉基础模型的深度先验能有效增强LiDAR数据的特征表达，提升3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使输入视图较少。它结合了多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，支持少样本泛化，并能构建任意时间的神经辐射场。实验表明，TimeNeRF无需逐场景优化即可生成平滑过渡的时间动态视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且效率低，而元宇宙等数字领域需要能自然过渡昼夜的3D环境建模。现有NeRF技术在时间动态场景建模方面潜力未充分挖掘，缺乏专用数据集。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场表示场景，支持少样本泛化，并能在任意时间构建神经辐射场，最终通过体渲染合成新视图。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，尤其擅长生成平滑过渡的时间动态视图，如从黎明到黄昏的自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间动态3D场景建模提供了高效通用的解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白，适用于元宇宙等需要沉浸式体验的应用。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

TL;DR: DiViD是一种端到端视频扩散框架，用于显式分离静态外观和动态运动，通过全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，结合条件DDPM解码器和正交正则化器，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法在视频中分离静态和动态信息时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: DiViD通过序列编码器提取全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，结合条件DDPM解码器（共享噪声计划、时间变化KL瓶颈和交叉注意力）和正交正则化器，实现静态-动态分离。

Result: DiViD在真实世界基准测试中表现优异，具有最高的交换联合准确率，保持静态保真度并改善动态传递，同时减少交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD通过显式静态-动态分解和创新的扩散框架，显著提升了视频中静态和动态信息的分离效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对视频理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the

metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了高效解决方案，并验证了VAR框架在此任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Conclusion: QuantEIT为EIT图像重建提供了高效、轻量的量子辅助解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for

with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Conclusion: 该方法为隧道健康状态快速准确评估提供了基础，并解释了深度学习模型的内部逻辑。

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of

achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

*Jiarong Ye,Sharon X. Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合情感和视觉内容的方法，用于情感驱动的图像编辑，包括数据集、模型和编辑工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感驱动的图像编辑中情感抽象性和多样性的挑战。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型；3. 提出Moodifier编辑模型。

Result: Moodifier在情感准确性和内容保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感内容创作提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

*Qiankun Ma,Ziyao Zhang,Chi Su,Jie Chen,Zhen Song,Hairong Zheng,Wen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba（VM）在长距离依赖捕捉上表现优异，但直接应用ViTs的token reduction技术会导致性能下降。本文提出MTR框架，无需训练即可显著降低计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率，解决直接应用ViTs的token reduction技术导致的性能问题。

Method: 提出Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，并基于此设计训练免费的MTR框架。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、无需训练的token reduction方法，适用于多种Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于冻结基础模型（FM）的类增量学习方法，用于皮肤病分类，通过轻量级MLP增量训练，实现了无需遗忘的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在皮肤病学中增量学习的潜力，解决现有方法在持续学习中的遗忘问题。

Method: 冻结预训练的FM主干，为每个任务训练轻量级MLP；同时探索零训练场景下的原型分类方法。

Result: 该方法在无需遗忘的情况下实现了最先进性能，原型分类方法也表现优异。

Conclusion: 冻结FM在皮肤病学持续学习中表现出色，支持其在真实医学应用中的广泛采用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种保护视觉语言模型知识产权的框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入水印，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法会破坏视觉-文本对齐，VLA-Mark旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标，动态平衡水印强度和语义保留。

Result: 实验显示PPL降低7.4%，BLEU提高26.6%，检测准确率达98.8% AUC。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark在保持文本-视觉一致性的同时，提供了高质量的多模态水印方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: 论文分析了四种人类匿名化技术对异常检测性能的影响，发现某些匿名化方法甚至能提高检测性能，同时探讨了隐私保护与检测效用之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但收集敏感人类数据引发隐私问题，研究旨在评估匿名化技术对异常检测的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用四种匿名化技术（模糊、掩码、加密、虚拟人替换），并评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）。

Result: 实验表明，匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，且某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）甚至能提高某些模型的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并强调了隐私保护与检测效用之间的权衡，为平衡隐私与检测需求提供了基准和见解。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一个无需训练的多视角多目标关联框架，结合图建模与极几何，提升3D重建中的目标关联鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，在目标视觉相似或噪声干扰时表现不佳。

Method: C-DOG通过连接delta重叠图建模和极几何，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差，实现鲁棒关联。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于几何基线，并在高目标密度、无视觉特征等挑战下表现稳健。

Conclusion: C-DOG适合实际场景中可扩展的3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Franca为开源视觉模型设立了新标准，推动了AI社区的可复现性和通用性。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at
https://github.com/valeoai/Franca.
