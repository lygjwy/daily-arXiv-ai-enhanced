While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B\nsignificantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over\nthe base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning\nbenchmarks.

Although such models can\ngenerate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling\ndemands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nwith high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the\nnumber of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this\nwork, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity\ntradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length\nof the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the\ntransformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its\nlength. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow\nmatching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an\narbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks.

However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly\nfocus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,\nobjects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.\nIn contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and\nnarrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately\nomit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and\nrelationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such\nimplicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context\nto construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail\nto capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this\ngap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test\nmodels on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs\nderived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized\ninto key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth\nand proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and\nmotivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred\ncounting.

Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they\nhaven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in\nhigh-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global\nframework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard\nbounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over\nDM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided\nby an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while\nminimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,\nT-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially\noverlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate\nActive-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world\napplications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates\nour hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,\nenhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more\neffective DMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Active-MoSH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6f\u786c\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u8f6f\u786c\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\uff08\u8f6f\u786c\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\uff08\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff09\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u504f\u597d\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "conclusion": "Active-MoSH\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002"}}

This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,\nrevealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse\nto a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms\nachieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's\ndesign-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural\ncomplexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful\nchallenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model\nthat incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional\ndistribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature\nof real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable\ndifficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability.

However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201cQuery as Test\u201d\uff08QaT\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57dfAI\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u201cExtensible Scenarios Notations\u201d\uff08ESN\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u201cValidation-Driven Development\u201d\uff08VDD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u9886\u57dfAI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u5ea7\u8231\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u4e14\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5806\u53e0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eAnswer Set Programming\uff08ASP\uff09\u7684ESN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "ESN\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff1bQaT\u8303\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u800c\u975e\u5b9a\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\uff08VDD\uff09\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4ee3\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

The proposed framework employs the video masked\nautoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the\nfacial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic\nsignals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)\nestimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms\nof video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic\nsignals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates\nphysiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological\nsignals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to\nthe model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where\nit is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos.

Inspired by the observation\nthat certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --\nconsistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like\ncognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of\ncognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce\nCogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.\nCogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,\nand employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit\nidentification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16\nwidely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that\nLRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also\nadaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses\nfurther uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit\nprofiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and\nDeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that\ncertain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with\nthe generation of harmful responses.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to\nimprove the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the\nsuboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly\navailable bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its\nsuperiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08R* DT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDT\u7684\u9884\u8bbeRTG\u503c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7ade\u4ef7\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u5de5\u5177\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u77ed\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DT\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9884\u8bbeRTG\u503c\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR* DT\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1aR DT\u5b58\u50a8\u72b6\u6001\u548cRTG\u503c\uff1bR^ DT\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u9ad8RTG\u503c\uff1bR* DT\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cR* DT\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6df7\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "R* DT\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u7ade\u4ef7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their\napplication to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant\ndomain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These\ndiscrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain\nrich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS\nunderstanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented\nMulti-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align\nmulti-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic\nAugmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics\nacross fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is\ndesigned to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge\ndatabase, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and\nmulti-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation\nacross multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design\nsemantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic\nrepresentation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical\nsemantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple\nRS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic\nlevels.

Removing 8.2% of flagged\nimages improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.\nCommonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation\naccuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training\nimages with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for\nmanual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two\ndermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater\ndisagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples.

UniCA is compatible and universal for\nadaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating\nextra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of\nTSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware\nforecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the\npromise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.\nCodes are released on https://github.com/hanlu-nju/UniCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniCA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u503c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u53d8\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u901a\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniCA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86UniCA\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UniCA\u4e3a\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed\n(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become\navailable.

From a probabilistic\nperspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model\nthe relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such\nprior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly\nregarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization\nprocedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations\nmade during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,\nwe propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined\nstructural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of\ncompatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural\nnetwork is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score\nmatching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries\nand shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions\nbeyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the\nmodel to perform both tensor completion and denoising.

Previous\nstate-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which\nforces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point.

In this\npaper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that\nretains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these\nlimitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the\nhighest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for\nwhich the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted\nsearch yields up to a \\(10\\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in\nstructural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using\nprior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the\ndata.

Beyond adaptation-based\nmethods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of\nvision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such\nknowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning\nvision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial\nprecision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between\nCLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of\nsegmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which\nintegrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head\nas the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision\nwith vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable\nsegmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features\ninto the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed\nprojection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight\ntrainable components.

However, the current\npractice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases\ninevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them\nprohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to\ndistill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics\npriors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable\nand naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into\nan implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional\nphysical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a\nphysics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to\nindoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic\nintegration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful\nfeatures from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic\nprogramming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a\nlow-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL\nconsistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces\ntraining time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5PiPRL\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165RL\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd9\u4e00\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PiPRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u6307\u5bfcRL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "PiPRL\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u6216\u795e\u7ecf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1126%\u3002", "conclusion": "PiPRL\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86RL\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving.

The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1.

However, these sensors are susceptible to physical\nattacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to\nunsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control\ncapabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We\npresent ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),\nan attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation\nunder adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor\nobservations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical\nstate via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher\nencoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware\nlatent states for RL policy training.

A prototype system for\nhypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,\ndemonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical\nguideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a\nlightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment.

To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline\nIntelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively\nsummarizing open-domain timelines.

Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization\nstrategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs\ninstruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information\nfiltering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment\nreward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal\nperspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution\nprinciples.

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3.

This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria\nand suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this\nlimitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization\nframework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal\ncomponents, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes\nclassification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness\nknowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the\ndisentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set\nimages contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between\npotential novel class instances and backgrounds.

To address these challenges, we propose\na Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure\nbackground base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to\nprovide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating\nunlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular\noptimization to enhance distribution uniformity.

To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic\nEnhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic\nrepresentation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three\nkey components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and\nlow-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve\nthe robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action\ndescription with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global\ncorrespondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the\ninherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated\ncross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance\nambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text\nfeatures, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that\nfrequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually\nand semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action\nrecognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFS-VAE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5206\u89e3\u589e\u5f3a\u9aa8\u67b6\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "FS-VAE\u5305\u542b\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u4ea4\u53c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9891\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c07\u3002", "conclusion": "FS-VAE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, recent studies\nindicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms\ninherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.\nMotivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing\nframework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed\nto systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing\nlanguage model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as\nefficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing\nclassifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of\neither the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the\nmessage-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach\nisolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,\navoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge\nProbing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge\nencoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,\nconsistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations\nacross different architectures.

While these\nperturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they\ncan actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data\naugmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on\nclassical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical\nmachine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere\nrotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet\neffective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional\naugmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations\nlack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like\nimage classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation\nmethods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to\nclassical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch\nrotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet\ndataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves\nimage classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5\naccuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard\nclassical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary\naugmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in\nprinciple, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential\napplications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation\napproach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy\nand discuss the implications of this limitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673aBloch\u7403\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673aBloch\u7403\u65cb\u8f6c\uff08SU(2)\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473%\uff0cTop-5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53472.5%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u4ece8%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523012%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9149\u53d8\u6362\u672a\u63d0\u5347\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These visual tokens\noften outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to\nsubstantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in\npractice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to\nor within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction\napproaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that\ntextual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this\nwork, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms\nof cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of\ntext-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a\ntraining-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual\ntokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on\ntextual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,\nwe treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a\nprogressive pruning pipeline.

These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing\nmethods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open\nand challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward\nhigh-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach.

However, most evaluations of language models\nrely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the\ncomplexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings.

To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential\nDiagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New\nEngland Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases\ninto stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case\nabstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper\nmodel that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is\nassessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician\nvisits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator\n(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,\nproposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,\ncost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%\ndiagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist\nphysicians.
