However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u7ed3\u675f\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u526a\u679d\u53bb\u9664\u4f4e\u8d21\u732e\u63a8\u7406\u5757\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6062\u590d\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982AIME\u548cAMC\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u9664\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to\nviewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that\nalter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized\nscenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View\nInvariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the\nrobustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL\nemploys a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the\nWaypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a\nview-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student\nmodel. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these\ncomponents, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical\nresults show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on\nV2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets\nR2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE\nsetting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often\nstill improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method\nalso achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to\nother map-free methods.

We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark.

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)\nis an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of\nbit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is\napplied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest\ncontribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection\ncriterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an\nefficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip\nfaults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can\nprovide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and\nweights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection\nmetric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,\ngradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to\ncalculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to\nenhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being\nprotected by TMR.

Next, PRISM\nuses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps\nthe embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while\npreserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the\ncommonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:\nhttps://github.com/MahdiyarMM/PRISM.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u635f\u5931\uff0cPRISM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0cPRISM\u65e8\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u504f\u5dee\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "PRISM\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u53bb\u504f\u635f\u5931\u5b66\u4e60\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "PRISM\u5728Waterbirds\u548cCelebA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Here, we used tools from natural\nlanguage processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from\nover 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery\nphenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced\nhallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while\nweak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision\nlanguage models better captured these differences than text-only language\nmodels, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer\nsensorimotor associations.

However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from\ntwo major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive\nitem embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low\ntraining efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network\nenvironments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since\ngradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining\nthe directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors\ncompared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS\nincorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nnumber of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate\nthat FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,\nwhile not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous\nscenarios.

Prior work reading out depth or\nillumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical\nfor flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a\nsim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,\nwhich can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer\nperturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we\nextend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular\narchitectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner\nis aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future\nframes (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat\neach spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that\ncan condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely\npresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.\nBuilding on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that\ninjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one\nstep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and\nunperturbed predictive distributions.

Next, we train a 3D\nbackbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating\ndirect semantic learning.

Evaluated across\nmultiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly\nenhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u526a\u679d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Integrated Gradients\u91cf\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9009\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u526a\u679d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u526a\u679d\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses.

Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams.

Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes\n20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new\nrobustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the\nrelated field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To\nimprove robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive\nLearning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic\nand partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance\nrobust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.\nBenchmarks, datasets, and code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/Kratos-Wen/RoHOI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2aHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6RoHOI\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faSAMPL\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RoHOI\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b20\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHICO-DET\u548cV-COCO\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faSAMPL\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u6e10\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSAMPL\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RoHOI\u57fa\u51c6\u548cSAMPL\u7b56\u7565\u4e3aHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli.

In this work, we present three common data\nbiases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic\ndiscrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We\nfind that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is\nless conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while\ncombinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical.

The Challenge of Teaching Reasoning to LLMs Without RL or Distillation", "comment": "Accepted at the Second AI for Math Workshop at the 42nd International\n  Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)", "summary": "Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in\ndiverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ntraces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning\ntraces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like\nDeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without\nfine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be\ninduced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20\nlong CoT examples from the reasoning model \\texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly\nfine-tune the base model \\texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms\nthe much larger \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of\nhigh-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further\nexplore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced\nwith prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,\nneither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that\ncertain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate.

We\nalso find that our system improves WER (from 0.73 to 0.08 for ADReSS and 0.15\nfor ADReSSo) and speech quality from 1.65 to ~2.15, enhancing privacy and\naccessibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aClaritySpeech\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ASR\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672cTTS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "motivation": "\u75f4\u5446\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c9f\u901a\u969c\u788d\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faClaritySpeech\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408ASR\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6df7\u6dc6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672cTTS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u8bed\u97f3\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADReSS\u548cADReSSo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d16%\u548c10%\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u630150%\u7684\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1bWER\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ClaritySpeech\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u53ef\u61c2\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

While tokenization has revolutionized\nimage and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a\ncritical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose\n$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method\ndecouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The\nintra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to\nhierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The\ninter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across\ntimesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while\nretaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only\nGPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and\npredicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene\ngeneration. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,\nensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that\n$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing\nmethods by 25.1\\% in mIoU and 36.9\\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while\nexhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of\ntraining memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

The HAPPO\nalgorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update\nscheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).\nHowever, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing\n(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$\nwith the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived\nfrom Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating\nthe conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential\npolicy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)\nas the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to\noptimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for\nOMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a\nCentralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously\nachieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function\ncomputation.

While pool-based\nprompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental\nlearning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper\npresents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,\nrevealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.\nThrough comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from\ntoken-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for\ntask-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,\nwe propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively\nshifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial\ndimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining\nlocal spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight\nkey patterns in input images.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term\ndecay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in\nLVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction\ntokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions\nwithin the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the\nbottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are\npositionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to\ninsufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.\nWe refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's\nperception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose\nMCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a\ntwo-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay.

They ascribe a\ndialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of\nacceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,\nbipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,\nto a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and\npropose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which\nare the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths.

To bridge this gap, this\npaper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models\n(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing\ncapability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the\nindexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual\nrelationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval.

For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the\ngeneralization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize\ntwo augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named\nKITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k\npairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories\nas extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.\nAdditionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not\nused in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely\nfor evaluating 3D anomaly detection.

Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling\n(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage\nguidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation\nfor empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The\nanalysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations.

Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making.

Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection.

This representation\nsupports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by\nenabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,\noffer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack\ntemporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines\nto enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term\npoint tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially\nwithout access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required.

Additionally, a confidence\nmisalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,\ncalibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes\nbounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP\nminimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization.

To capture and transfer these movements\ninto virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,\nwhich enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without\nfront-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as\nocclusions and distorted body proportions.\n  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,\nand none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars\nfrom a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view\ndatasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a\ngenerative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.\nBased on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves\ngeneralizability.\n  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree\nreconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates\nrealistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a\nStable Diffusion backbone.\n  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic\nfrontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables\ngeneration of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more\naccessible and generalizable telepresence systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528Stable Diffusion\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u60f3\u6570\u5b57\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u5b58\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u6bd4\u4f8b\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5efa\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\u548cControlNet\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4fef\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u4fef\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6700\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers.

FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient.

However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set.

The peer-reviewed version of this paper has been\n  accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD", "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for\napplications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities.

While imitation learning in discrete\nsettings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and\npopularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous\ndriving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the\ncompounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform\nstably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential\ncompounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled\ntrajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or\ndata augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably\nmitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.\nWhen the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe \"action chunking,\" i.e.,\npredicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is\npossibly unstable, we prescribe \"noise injection,\" i.e., adding noise during\nexpert demonstrations.

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal\nsynchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce\nDejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle\ntemporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream\nMMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different\nmodels and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced\nsensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while\nobject tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a\nsingle-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to\n88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy\n(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense\npatch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal\nalignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal\nshared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path\nof temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment.

Building on these\nobservations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework\nfor 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention\nPrediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the\nglobal attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token\nimportance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual\ntoken Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through\nattention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise\npruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques\noperate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive\nevaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,\nparticularly under high visual token pruning ratios.

The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:\nimage acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,\nnormalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with\nKeras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional\nlayers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max\npooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax\noutput for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training\naccuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although\na validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model\nintegrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by\nmapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.\nFurthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible\nplatform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote\nareas.

While prior\nwork has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional\narchitectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space\nmodels (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose\nunique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter\ndynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on\nGrowth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the\nimpact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM\nfor three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models\n(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance\nresilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on\nclean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)\nrobustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to\n8.8% over existing baselines.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance.

Despite recent\nprogress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to\npursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the\nexpense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These\nmodels typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small\ntargets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance\nand efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of\nRobust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network\n(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware\nprior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods\nthat rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a\ndynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables\nthe model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the\ninput scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse\nbackgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to\nbetter capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more\naccurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that\nDRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in\ndetection accuracy.

Recently, the\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable\nadvancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent\nlimitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the\nunique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent\nocclusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished\nperformance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video\nobject segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and\nocclusion-resilient memory models.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources.

Various deep learning\napproaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have\nbeen developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).\nHowever, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and\nmonocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its\nconversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of\nprompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract\nestimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a\nframework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for\nabsolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and\nhigh-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program\n(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived\nDEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM\nestimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x\nresolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of\nmagnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust\ngeneralization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with\n< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological\nanalysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We\ndemonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.\nand Israel.

Recent works have further enhanced these\ncapabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming\nsignificant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,\nsome studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance\nreasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable.

VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can\nbe improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the\ndistribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation\ngradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to\nsuffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform\nan in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model\nand the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA\nand 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their\noptimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score\nmodel looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable\ncorrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable\ntraining in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we\npropose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving\nrise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).\n$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff\nfunctionalities of existing deep learning libraries.

Using test statistics derived from\nnonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data\nduring calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths\nfor generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance.

Although deep\nlearning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D\nshapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape\nrepresentations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.\nWe hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form\nrepresentations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their\nrepresentations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two\nhuman experiments systematically manipulating point density and object\norientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).\nHumans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We\ncompared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with\nhuman performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better\naccount of human performance than the convolution-based model.

However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery.

Whether strict rotation\nequivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone\nand neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with\napproximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the\nimpact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.\nAdditionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter\ncount while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned\nimprovements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant\nsingle-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an\nexceptionally low parameter count.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08MessDet\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5206\u652f\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u9888\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5206\u652f\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728DOTA-v1.0\u3001DOTA-v1.5\u548cDIOR-R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5bf9\u822a\u7a7a\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u591a\u5206\u652f\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

In our\nexperiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by\n$10\\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and\ntrained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of\ndiverse multi-modal benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hyma\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "Hyma\u5c06\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e10\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Hyma\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues.

Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews.

Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss.

This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as\nempirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters\ninferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to\ndemystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks\nthrough real-life examples and intuitive visualizations.

To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token\nClustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based\ndownsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic\nmeanings instead of spatial positions.

Conversely, the structure of resamplers\nshows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains\nunexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,\na novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and\ntemporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key\ncomponents: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique\nsemantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative\nconcepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring\nconsistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video\nframe.

Our\nanalysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under\ngeneral, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the\nparticipation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic\nFedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg\nvariants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u53c2\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645FL\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u53c2\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u8054\u90a6\u5e73\u5747\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FedAvg\uff09\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51f8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u975e\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684FedAvg\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,\nwe propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance\nscenarios.

To\nfacilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap\ndataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate\npractitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing\ncompletely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent\npattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic\nvariables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks\nconsistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex\nmissingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean\nabsolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate\ntechniques for transition point missingness.

For example, detecting\ndifferent kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.\n  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained\nZero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of\ndifferent classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We\ndevelop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on\nan improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware\nembedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and\nsemantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for\nthe new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,\nwhich contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera\nand 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method\noutperforms existing ZSD models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08FG-ZSD\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684MSHC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2aFG-ZSD\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6FGZSD-Birds\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ZSD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u9700\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u9e1f\u7c7b\u3001\u9c7c\u7c7b\u548c\u82b1\u5349\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSHC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7684FGZSD-Birds\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMSHC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709ZSD\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous\nqueries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or\nunder-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To\naddress these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user\nquery through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to\nbridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early\nmethods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from\ntoken co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or\npurchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically\ntransformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are\nbeing used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize\nthe semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user\nintent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a\ntoken classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware\ntransformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of\na token for learning superior query phrase embedding.

In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a\nRefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating\nmasks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask.

In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely\non cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes\nand weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel\nretrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)\nand geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate\nencoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a\nshared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,\ninstead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,\nwe propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by\nmodeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface.

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of\nthis issue.

In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor\nlocalization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a\nrobot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an\nedge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen\npeople. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different\naccuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to\n99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%\naccuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the\naccuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework\ncreates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall\naccuracy of 99.99%.

Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and\ncannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in\nthe digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,\nthey focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal\ndata and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to\naggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space\nby converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal\nembedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces\naction nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other\nnodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

To address this,\nwe propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks\nacross five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing\n103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.\nBuilding on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework\nwith three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query\nusing both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level\nfusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers\nto similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities\nbetween models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as\ntraining data.
