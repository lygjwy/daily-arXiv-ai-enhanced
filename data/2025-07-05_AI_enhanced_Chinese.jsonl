This method is a hybrid\nof non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality\nreduction.

In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based\nevent stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,\nwe first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input\nevent stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given\ngeneration prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the\npre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be\noptimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we\nalso propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage\nprocessing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset\nprovides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent\nreasoning-based large models.

However, intelligent\nmachines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge\nvolume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques\nand rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive\ndata. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object\npairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the\ndiscriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature\nselection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved\nsamples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory\nability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.\nFirst, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the\ndiscriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set\nwithin an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of\nthe probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature\nsubset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be\nestimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes\nwere used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate\nreducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory\nability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.\nExperiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate\nreduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a\npersonal computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6b63\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6837\u672c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff0c\u4e14\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0b\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the\nfeedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by\nPQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter\ncontribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the\nparameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have\nprimarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the\nFFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,\nexpressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a\nresidual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating\nentanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our\nexperiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia\nbenchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured\nQFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its\nclassical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific\nparameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive\nedge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data\nefficiency.

Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a\ncritical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and\npredictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in\nsemiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high\ndata dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,\nnoisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production\nsystems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the\ndelayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly\ndetection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic\napproach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed\nmethodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into\nimage-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)\ndeveloping a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16\narchitecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese\nnetwork composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned\nVGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one\nserving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the\nother as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the\nembeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at\na given time step.

As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two\ntasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given\npaper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,\nwhich retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We\nprovide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose\nConfidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation\nmetric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses\nlimitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where\nmultiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also\nserve as GAs.

An essential component for modeling graph\nstructures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs.

On the system level, AIRES employs a\nthree-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy\nutilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage\n(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.\nEvaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing\nbenchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AIRES\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5-\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fGCN\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u683c\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\uff08\u7ed3\u5408GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3001GDS\u548c\u4e3b\u673a\u5185\u5b58\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAIRES\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe1.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "AIRES\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u5b58SpGEMM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3aGCN\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables\nflexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks\nwithout modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a\nstructured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling\noperators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model\nlayers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an\nequivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight\nadapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while\nmitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that\nthe proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric\ninductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during\nadaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse\ngeometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph\ncontrol, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,\nmolecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation.

Existing\nmethods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need\nadditional data and significant computational resources. To address these\nissues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement\noccupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame\n3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a\nfeature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow\nMatching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and\nPlane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the\nimpact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall\nefficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes.

In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards.

Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers\n(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy\nvalue to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions\nthrough gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across\nboth discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale\nfaster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an\nup to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,\nFLOPs, and depth.

Typically, satellite or airborne images used\nfor training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where\nthe same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this\npaper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for\ncross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on\nextracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in\nthe independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and\nseparability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we\npropose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to\nfocus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target\nscenes in noise condition.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

Our approach extends conformal prediction to\ndynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by\ntemporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based\nnon-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties\nwithin evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware\noptimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,\nenhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,\nDBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to\nensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction\nin prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Besides significant changes, slow\nchanges in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios.

Therefore, designing a change detection\nnetwork that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel\nchallenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change\ndetection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow\nbranch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid\nstructure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one\ncombines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to\ngenerate fast change outputs.

This competitive\nranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt\ncoupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as\norder volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to\nmarket fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints\nis a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain\nscarce.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based\nsubsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing\nadjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition\nAdaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and\nReinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget\nconstraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.\nFurthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment\ntailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation\nand benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising\nreal-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse\nmarket conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for\nride-hailing service providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks.

To overcome this gap, we\nintroduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a\ncollaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data\nquality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.\nFirst, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected\nvideos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,\nwater turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action\nobservation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several\nchallenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis\nof different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that\nfine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world\nunderstanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing\nin-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation.

The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack.

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN\nremoval grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger\nmodels is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.\nFurthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct\nlogit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,\nwhile the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve.

Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods\ncan be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the\nfundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a\nconsistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity\nthroughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine\ndetails. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details.

Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying\nthe global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from\narbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations.

Central to this approach is\na generative mechanism that creates \\emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem\ninstances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \\emph{soft constraints}\nand unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables\nthe framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby\nfreeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely\non human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and\nseeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner\niteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,\nregularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and\nconstraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy\ncorresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at\nlower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By\ninterpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \\emph{functors} that generate\nand condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional\nstructure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively\ngeneralised tasks.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios.

Results show that rule-based agents achieve\nnear-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability\n(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL\nagents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest\nvolatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced\napproach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while\nmaintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing.

It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

Inspired by this dual processes of\nforgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and\nGrow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,\nExperience Replay Decay (ER Decay) \"forgetting early experience\", which\nbalances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.\nSecond, Network Expansion, \"growing neural capacity\", which enhances agents'\ncapability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new\nparameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control\nbenchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG\nagainst SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFoG\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u9057\u5fd8\u65e9\u671f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u201d\u548c\u201c\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u52a0\u7f51\u7edc\u5bb9\u91cf\u201d\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff08primacy bias\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5a74\u513f\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FoG\u7b97\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) Experience Replay Decay\uff08ER Decay\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u65e9\u671f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2) Network Expansion\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u52a0\u7f51\u7edc\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u572840\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFoG\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SoTA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BRO\u3001SimBa\u3001TD-MPC2\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FoG\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u751f\u957f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86primacy bias\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Building on this\nparadigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction\nacross Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein\ninteraction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical\nattributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.\nThe proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that\nemulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The\nframework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a\ndata-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned\nembedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data\nregimes.

First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different\npatches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport\nstrategy.

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information.

At\ntraining time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on\nwell-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.\nHowever, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual\ndescriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are\nincomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,\nwe make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data\navailable during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates\nof treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text\nconfounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time\nbut only partially available through text at inference time.

By revisiting existing methods, we identify a\ncore limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to\naccount for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation\nduring denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature\ninjection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising\nprocess. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the\nmodel to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure\npreservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful\nstructural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and\na restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual\nquality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both\nstructure-rich and appearance-rich.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on\npredicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D\nGaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by\nreparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.\nThis trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing models.

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration.

However, without\nusing large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt\nto specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused\nby a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training\ndatasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited\ninformation about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In\nthis paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in\nspecialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we\nidentify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,\ni.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.\nTo address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple\nbootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,\nbounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more\nfaithful to input images.

Across 4 video datasets (K600,\nUCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all\nevaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or\nhigher compression ratios.
