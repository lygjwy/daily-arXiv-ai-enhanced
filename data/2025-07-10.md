### [1] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个三维多人模拟工具，用于在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络，提升学员的决策能力和学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏一种能在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络的工具，以评估离线和在线决策性能。

Method: 开发了基于Unity的MEWI模拟器，模拟战场约束和不确定性，并设计了两个实战场景。

Result: MEWI显著提升了学员对医疗后送知识的学习效果和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是高保真医疗教育工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗后送教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [2] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)，一种新型的提示表示方法，旨在解决现有框架在灵活性和定制性上的不足，提升程序员效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程框架要么过于复杂，要么缺乏灵活性，难以支持高级的代理编程需求。

Method: 提出PDL，将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动提示调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。

Result: 通过合规代理的案例研究，PDL的提示调优实现了4倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: PDL通过声明式表示和优化能力，显著提升了提示工程的效率和性能。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [3] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了Jolting Technologies假说，提出AI能力发展可能呈现超指数增长（即加速增长或正三阶导数），并通过理论框架和蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI能力发展的超指数增长模式及其潜在影响，为未来实证研究提供工具。

Method: 开发理论框架，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，分析缩短的创意到行动间隔和迭代AI改进的复合效应。

Result: 提供了形式化的jolt动态模型和检测方法，为理解AI发展轨迹及其对AGI出现的影响奠定数学基础。

Conclusion: 研究为AI发展超指数增长的可能性提供了理论支持，并为研究和政策制定提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [4] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，后者又比d-辩证系统更强，突出了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统的不同模型，以理解其在自动信念修正和数学推理中的作用。

Method: 区分并比较三种辩证系统模型：d-、p-和q-辩证系统，证明q-系统比p-系统更强大。

Result: q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，后者又严格强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 反例和矛盾在信念修正中具有互补作用，这对自动代理和数学推理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [5] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架（AFs），并提出了两种方法，评估了其方向性，并在有限框架中验证了部分语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCC递归语义在有限AFs中有效，但在无限AFs中因基础性问题失效，需要扩展以适应无限设置。

Method: 提出两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并基于Baroni和Giacomin的标准系统评估其方向性。

Result: 方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究推进了无限论证理论，为处理无界或演化领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [6] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，提升指令数据的覆盖范围和深度，构建了高质量数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据集虽规模庞大，但在复杂指令和罕见领域任务上表现不佳，需提升数据的覆盖范围和深度。

Method: 提出包含分层标注系统、信息种子选择算法、进化数据合成过程及模型缺陷诊断与针对性数据生成的框架。

Result: 构建了包含约150万指令的高质量数据集，实验证明其提升模型指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

### [7] [The User-Centric Geo-Experience: An LLM-Powered Framework for Enhanced Planning, Navigation, and Dynamic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06993)
*Jieren Deng,Aleksandar Cvetkovic,Pak Kiu Chung,Dragomir Yankov,Chiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态旅行规划系统，通过三个协作代理解决传统系统在智能规划、精准导航和动态适应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界中的复杂性和意外中断，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 设计了三个代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（提供精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG应对中断）。

Result: 系统显著提升了查询解释、导航准确性和中断恢复能力。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多个领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E是一种结构化探索框架，通过识别推理轨迹中的高不确定性决策点并提供针对性反馈，改善了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然提升了LLM的推理能力，但存在探索不稳定的问题。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，通过高不确定性决策点的识别和针对性rollout构建语义基础的中介反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E实现了更稳定的训练、更长且连贯的响应，以及更高比例的完全正确轨迹。

Conclusion: FR3E通过更稳健和结构化的探索，有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.

### [9] [Neural Network-Based Parameter Estimation for Non-Autonomous Differential Equations with Discontinuous Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06267)
*Hyeontae Jo,Krešimir Josić,Jae Kyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HADES-NN的新方法，通过神经网络平滑近似不连续信号，用于非自主微分方程的参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非自主微分方程在建模受外部信号影响的系统时很重要，但信号突变时参数估计变得困难。

Method: HADES-NN分两阶段：1) 用神经网络平滑近似不连续信号；2) 用平滑信号估计模型参数。

Result: HADES-NN在多种应用中（如生物钟系统、酵母交配响应）提供了高精度参数估计。

Conclusion: HADES-NN显著扩展了可拟合实际测量数据的模型范围。

Abstract: Non-autonomous differential equations are crucial for modeling systems
influenced by external signals, yet fitting these models to data becomes
particularly challenging when the signals change abruptly. To address this
problem, we propose a novel parameter estimation method utilizing functional
approximations with artificial neural networks. Our approach, termed Harmonic
Approximation of Discontinuous External Signals using Neural Networks
(HADES-NN), operates in two iterated stages. In the first stage, the algorithm
employs a neural network to approximate the discontinuous signal with a smooth
function. In the second stage, it uses this smooth approximate signal to
estimate model parameters. HADES-NN gives highly accurate and precise parameter
estimates across various applications, including circadian clock systems
regulated by external light inputs measured via wearable devices and the mating
response of yeast to external pheromone signals. HADES-NN greatly extends the
range of model systems that can be fit to real-world measurements.

*Harsh Ravivarapu,Gaurav Bagwe,Xiaoyong Yuan,Chunxiu Yu,Lan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEA-DBS是一种基于强化学习的自适应深脑刺激框架，通过预测奖励模型和Gumbel Softmax探索方法，解决了样本效率低和硬件资源受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开环DBS缺乏适应性和个性化，且能耗高。自适应DBS（aDBS）虽能动态调节刺激，但现有强化学习方法存在样本复杂度高、探索不稳定和硬件兼容性差的问题。

Method: 提出SEA-DBS框架，结合预测奖励模型和Gumbel Softmax探索方法，优化样本效率和策略更新稳定性。

Result: 在帕金森病基底节活动的生物仿真中，SEA-DBS表现出更快的收敛速度、更强的病理β波段抑制能力，并能适应FP16量化。

Conclusion: SEA-DBS为资源受限的实时神经调控提供了一种实用且有效的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established intervention for Parkinson's
disease (PD), but conventional open-loop systems lack adaptability, are
energy-inefficient due to continuous stimulation, and provide limited
personalization to individual neural dynamics. Adaptive DBS (aDBS) offers a
closed-loop alternative, using biomarkers such as beta-band oscillations to
dynamically modulate stimulation. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds
promise for personalized aDBS control, existing methods suffer from high sample
complexity, unstable exploration in binary action spaces, and limited
deployability on resource-constrained hardware.
  We propose SEA-DBS, a sample-efficient actor-critic framework that addresses
the core challenges of RL-based adaptive neurostimulation. SEA-DBS integrates a
predictive reward model to reduce reliance on real-time feedback and employs
Gumbel Softmax-based exploration for stable, differentiable policy updates in
binary action spaces. Together, these components improve sample efficiency,
exploration robustness, and compatibility with resource-constrained
neuromodulatory hardware. We evaluate SEA-DBS on a biologically realistic
simulation of Parkinsonian basal ganglia activity, demonstrating faster
convergence, stronger suppression of pathological beta-band power, and
resilience to post-training FP16 quantization. Our results show that SEA-DBS
offers a practical and effective RL-based aDBS framework for real-time,
resource-constrained neuromodulation.

Conclusion: SymFlux为哈密顿力学的自动化发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present SymFlux, a novel deep learning framework that performs symbolic
regression to identify Hamiltonian functions from their corresponding vector
fields on the standard symplectic plane. SymFlux models utilize hybrid CNN-LSTM
architectures to learn and output the symbolic mathematical expression of the
underlying Hamiltonian. Training and validation are conducted on newly
developed datasets of Hamiltonian vector fields, a key contribution of this
work. Our results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately
recovering these symbolic expressions, advancing automated discovery in
Hamiltonian mechanics.

### [12] [DecoyDB: A Dataset for Graph Contrastive Learning in Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06366)
*Yupu Zhang,Zelin Xu,Tingsong Xiao,Gustavo Seabra,Yanjun Li,Chenglong Li,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DecoyDB数据集和定制化的GCL框架，用于蛋白质-配体复合物的自监督学习，显著提升了结合亲和力预测的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDBbind数据集规模小且标签有限，阻碍了结合亲和力预测的进展，而自监督学习（尤其是GCL）为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 构建DecoyDB数据集（包含高质量复合物和多样化诱饵结构），并设计定制化的GCL框架进行预训练和微调。

Result: 实验表明，基于DecoyDB预训练的模型在准确性、标签效率和泛化能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: DecoyDB和定制化GCL框架为蛋白质-配体复合物的结合亲和力预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes plays a vital
role in drug discovery. Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack
of large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used
PDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,
especially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to
break the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast
unlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.
However, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a
comprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex
pairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique
characteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a
large-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised
GCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground
truth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with
computationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal
(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation
(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to
pre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with
labels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with
DecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability.

Motivation: 探索深度线性卷积网络在梯度流下的几何特性，特别是与参数空间和函数空间的关系。

Method: 通过分析梯度流在参数空间的表现，证明其可以表示为函数空间上的黎曼梯度流，适用于多维卷积和特定的一维卷积条件。

Result: 梯度流在参数空间的表现可以转化为函数空间的黎曼梯度流，且不受初始化条件限制，适用于D≥2的卷积和特定的一维卷积。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解深度线性卷积网络的优化过程提供了新的几何视角，扩展了梯度流理论的应用范围。

Abstract: We study geometric properties of the gradient flow for learning deep linear
convolutional networks. For linear fully connected networks, it has been shown
recently that the corresponding gradient flow on parameter space can be written
as a Riemannian gradient flow on function space (i.e., on the product of weight
matrices) if the initialization satisfies a so-called balancedness condition.
We establish that the gradient flow on parameter space for learning linear
convolutional networks can be written as a Riemannian gradient flow on function
space regardless of the initialization. This result holds for $D$-dimensional
convolutions with $D \geq 2$, and for $D =1$ it holds if all so-called strides
of the convolutions are greater than one. The corresponding Riemannian metric
depends on the initialization.

TL;DR: WINGs框架通过动态生成权重和压缩权重，显著减少深度神经网络的内存需求，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂神经网络存储大量权重所需的高内存问题，适用于资源受限的边缘应用。

Method: 使用PCA降维和轻量级SVR模型预测FC网络权重，结合敏感性分析压缩CNN权重。

Result: FC层压缩53倍，AlexNet在MNIST上压缩28倍，CIFAR-10上压缩18倍，精度损失1-2%。

Conclusion: WINGs显著降低内存需求，提高吞吐量并减少能耗，适用于边缘计算。

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性循环模型中的梯度下降学习提供了新的理论工具，并通过实验和理论验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Gradient Descent (GD) and its variants are the primary tool for enabling
efficient training of recurrent dynamical systems such as Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), Neural ODEs and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs). The dynamics
that are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and
emergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable
generalization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of
these representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial
systems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to
rigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,
especially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,
which describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into
a product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a
Linearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in
feed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal
control theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we
show how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under
GD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,
over and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task
training, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives
relevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically
validate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \emph{KPFlow},
implementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken
together, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD
learning in non-linear recurrent models.

Abstract: With the proliferation of wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) systems for health
monitoring and authentication, protecting signal integrity against tampering is
becoming increasingly important. This paper analyzes the performance of CNN,
ResNet, and hybrid Transformer-CNN models for tamper detection. It also
evaluates the performance of a Siamese network for ECG based identity
verification. Six tampering strategies, including structured segment
substitutions and random insertions, are emulated to mimic real world attacks.
The one-dimensional ECG signals are transformed into a two dimensional
representation in the time frequency domain using the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT). The models are trained and evaluated using ECG data from 54
subjects recorded in four sessions 2019 to 2025 outside of clinical settings
while the subjects performed seven different daily activities. Experimental
results show that in highly fragmented manipulation scenarios, CNN,
FeatCNN-TranCNN, FeatCNN-Tran and ResNet models achieved an accuracy exceeding
99.5 percent . Similarly, for subtle manipulations (for example, 50 percent
from A and 50 percent from B and, 75 percent from A and 25 percent from B
substitutions) our FeatCNN-TranCNN model demonstrated consistently reliable
performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98 percent . For identity
verification, the pure Transformer-Siamese network achieved an average accuracy
of 98.30 percent . In contrast, the hybrid CNN-Transformer Siamese model
delivered perfect verification performance with 100 percent accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KnowRare是一个基于领域适应的深度学习框架，用于预测ICU中罕见疾病的临床结果，通过自监督预训练和条件知识图谱解决数据稀缺和异质性问题，表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU中罕见疾病由于数据稀缺和异质性，临床预测效果不佳，亟需解决方案。

Method: 开发KnowRare框架，结合自监督预训练和条件知识图谱，从相似疾病中迁移知识。

Result: 在五个临床预测任务中表现优于现有模型和ICU评分系统，并展示出灵活性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: KnowRare为ICU罕见疾病的临床决策提供了实用且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common
conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including
recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain
underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge
such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning
framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU.
KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic
representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised
pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively
adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed
condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical
prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality,
remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed
existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior
predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including
APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in
adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific
characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data
scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings
highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for
supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in
the ICU.

TL;DR: eegFloss是一个开源Python包，用于检测睡眠EEG记录中的伪影，提高睡眠研究的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号易受伪影干扰，影响自动睡眠分期的准确性，eegFloss旨在解决这一问题。

Method: eegFloss利用eegUsability（一种机器学习模型）检测伪影，并包含其他功能如自动检测在床时间。

Result: eegUsability表现良好（F1-score约0.85，Cohen's kappa 0.78），能高召回率识别可用EEG数据。

Conclusion: eegFloss提升了睡眠研究的精确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) allows monitoring of brain activity, providing
insights into the functional dynamics of various brain regions and their roles
in cognitive processes. EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the
primary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,
EEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)
factors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are
becoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly
susceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper
addresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package
to utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect
segments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained
and evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15
participants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid
overall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens
kappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in
identifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.
Additionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection
using another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and
generating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental
challenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and
rigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their
outcomes.

Method: 在合成分类任务上独立训练数百个Transformer模型，分析其注意力模式与OOD泛化能力的相关性。

Result: 发现简单的可解释性工具（如注意力模式）可以预测OOD性能，尤其是当注意力呈现分层模式时，模型倾向于在OOD数据上分层泛化。

Conclusion: 研究为可解释性在预测未见模型行为方面的应用提供了概念验证，鼓励进一步探索。

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

Conclusion: FedPhD在联邦学习环境中高效训练扩散模型，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models
over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed
training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators
that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs
and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers
and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues
in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel
approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD
leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and
selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication
costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational
efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments
across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model
performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing
communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods
achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of
the total computation and communication resources.

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) encode rich biological information, yet their
internal neuron representations are poorly understood. We introduce the first
automated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically
grounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on
sparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of
thousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to
diverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron
activation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,
enabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and
instability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,
including alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers. We finally show that
analysis of labeled neurons in different model sizes reveals PLM scaling laws
and a structured neuron space distribution.

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上表现接近实值算法，能耗降低约一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为高能耗问题提供了有效解决方案，适合硬件加速实现。

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine
learning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to
larger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main
algorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant
challenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial
dependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for
the backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;
here the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this
study, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.
Binarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing
operations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,
combined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the
information bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and
expensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be
implemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of
unstable magnets. We evaluate our proposed algorithms on the MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing that its performance is close to
real-valued forward-forward, but with an estimated energy savings of about one
order of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam在训练深度神经网络中表现优异，但其成功机制和局限性尚未充分探索。研究旨在增强Adam的优势并缓解其不足。

Method: 提出SignSoftSGD（S3），采用p阶动量、统一指数移动平均系数和Nesterov加速梯度模块，优化更新机制。

Result: S3在非凸随机优化中达到最优收敛率，实验显示其收敛更快、性能更优，且极少出现损失尖峰。

Conclusion: S3在效率和最终任务性能上均优于AdamW，验证了其作为优化器的有效性。

Abstract: Adam has proven remarkable successful in training deep neural networks, but
the mechanisms underlying its empirical successes and limitations remain
underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam
stems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large
gradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes
due to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and
mitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with
three key innovations. \emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by
employing a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \geq 1$) in the denominator,
departing from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)
preconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving
stable training even with aggressive learning rates. \emph{Second}, S3
minimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving
average coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently
bound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \emph{Third}, S3
incorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,
accelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that
S3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic
optimization under weak assumptions. Extensive experiments across a range of
vision and language tasks show that \textsf{\small S3} not only converges more
rapidly and improves performance but also rarely experiences loss spikes, even
with a \textbf{$\bm{10 \times}$} larger learning rate. In fact, S3 delivers
performance comparable to or better than AdamW with \textbf{$2 \times$} the
training steps, establishing its efficacy in both efficiency and final task
performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FMSP的新方法，利用基础模型的代码生成能力和广泛知识，通过三种变体（vFMSP、NSSP、QDSP）克服自对弈算法的局限性，提升策略多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自对弈算法（SP）在生成多样化解决方案和避免局部最优行为方面存在不足，FMSP旨在通过基础模型的能力解决这些问题。

Method: FMSP包括三种方法：vFMSP通过竞争性自对弈优化策略；NSSP专注于策略多样性；QDSP结合多样性和高质量策略。实验在Car Tag和Gandalf场景中进行。

Result: 在Car Tag中，FMSP超越了人类设计的策略；在Gandalf中，FMSP成功突破LLM的防御并自动修复漏洞。

Conclusion: FMSP为自对弈算法提供了新的研究方向，推动了更具创造性和开放性的策略发现。

Abstract: Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery

Conclusion: MimbFD通过双视图学习有效缓解了信息传播不均问题，提升了欺诈检测性能。

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud
detection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node
representations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the
focus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global
topological information and increased risk of node-specific information being
overwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign
nodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class
imbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of
imbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior
obfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,
we propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate
Message imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a
topological message reachability module for high-quality node representation
learning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient
propagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust
node representations, enhancing the stable association between node
representations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.
Finally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the
results demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud
detection.

Conclusion: FedDifRC通过扩散模型的指导成功缓解了数据异质性，并在理论和实验上均表现出色。

Abstract: Federated learning aims at training models collaboratively across
participants while protecting privacy. However, one major challenge for this
paradigm is the data heterogeneity issue, where biased data preferences across
multiple clients, harming the model's convergence and performance. In this
paper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning
paradigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during
federated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion
representations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel
diffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation
Collaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion
models to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven
diffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to
provide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence
signals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the
diffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive
learning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency
regularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising
representations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In
addition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying
on any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to
ensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different
scenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial
components.

Abstract: As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal
role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture
for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing
models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency
characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal
performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling
periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an
innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency
domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the
pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively
transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets
with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency
and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing
mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input
signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared
to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation
benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from
real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this
dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical
commercial applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持概率排序的同时，提供了高效、可解释且鲁棒的校准解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce miscalibrated probability estimates,
leading to overconfident predictions. A common approach for calibration is
fitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms
predicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is
instance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability
outputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee
monotonicity. Previous monotonic approaches either use an under-parameterized
calibration map with limited expressive ability or rely on black-box neural
networks, which lack interpretability and robustness. In this paper, we propose
a family of novel monotonic post-hoc calibration methods, which employs a
constrained calibration map parameterized linearly with respect to the number
of classes. Our proposed approach ensures expressiveness, robustness, and
interpretability while preserving the relative ordering of the probability
output by formulating the proposed calibration map as a constrained
optimization problem. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance
across datasets with different deep neural network models, outperforming
existing calibration methods while being data and computation-efficient. Our

Abstract: Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient
descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in
high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with
dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new
differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates
tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a
differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each
parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune
low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping
mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically,
we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy
and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported
under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test
accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching
the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at
$\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating
that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.

Conclusion: CircuitGCL通过创新的表示学习和标签平衡方法，显著提升了电路图的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is
crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the
scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the
inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to
learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these
limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning
framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to
enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs
a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through
hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale
data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (MSE) and softmax
cross-entropy (bsmCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution
disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic
estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and
ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS
designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the
$R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score
gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is

Abstract: Graph representation learning is a powerful method to extract features from
graph-structured data, such as analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. However,
training deep learning models for AMS designs is severely limited by the
scarcity of integrated circuit design data. In this work, we present
CircuitGPS, a few-shot learning method for parasitic effect prediction in AMS
circuits. The circuit netlist is represented as a heterogeneous graph, with the
coupling capacitance modeled as a link. CircuitGPS is pre-trained on link
prediction and fine-tuned on edge regression. The proposed method starts with a
small-hop sampling technique that converts a link or a node into a subgraph.
Then, the subgraph embeddings are learned with a hybrid graph Transformer.
Additionally, CircuitGPS integrates a low-cost positional encoding that
summarizes the positional and structural information of the sampled subgraph.
CircuitGPS improves the accuracy of coupling existence by at least 20\% and
reduces the MAE of capacitance estimation by at least 0.067 compared to
existing methods. Our method demonstrates strong inherent scalability, enabling
direct application to diverse AMS circuit designs through zero-shot learning.
Furthermore, the ablation studies provide valuable insights into graph models
for representation learning.

Conclusion: 挑战了去中心化学习在数据异构和有限通信下泛化差的传统观点，为模型合并和损失景观提供新见解。

Abstract: Decentralized learning provides a scalable alternative to traditional
parameter-server-based training, yet its performance is often hindered by
limited peer-to-peer communication. In this paper, we study how communication
should be scheduled over time, including determining when and how frequently
devices synchronize. Our empirical results show that concentrating
communication budgets in the later stages of decentralized training markedly
improves global generalization. Surprisingly, we uncover that fully connected
communication at the final step, implemented by a single global merging, is
sufficient to match the performance of server-based training. We further show
that low communication in decentralized learning preserves the
\textit{mergeability} of local models throughout training. Our theoretical
contributions, which explains these phenomena, are first to establish that the
globally merged model of decentralized SGD can converge faster than centralized
mini-batch SGD. Technically, we novelly reinterpret part of the discrepancy
among local models, which were previously considered as detrimental noise, as
constructive components that accelerate convergence. This work challenges the
common belief that decentralized learning generalizes poorly under data
heterogeneity and limited communication, while offering new insights into model
merging and neural network loss landscapes.

Abstract: To achieve higher system energy efficiency, SRAM in SoCs is often customized.
The parasitic effects cause notable discrepancies between pre-layout and
post-layout circuit simulations, leading to difficulty in converging design
parameters and excessive design iterations. Is it possible to well predict the
parasitics based on the pre-layout circuit, so as to perform parasitic-aware
pre-layout simulation? In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based 2-stage
model to accurately predict these parasitics in pre-layout stages. The model
combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) regressors, effectively managing class imbalance of the net parasitics in
SRAM circuits. We also employ Focal Loss to mitigate the impact of abundant
internal net samples and integrate subcircuit information into the graph to
abstract the hierarchical structure of schematics. Experiments on 4 real SRAM
designs show that our approach not only surpasses the state-of-the-art model in
parasitic prediction by a maximum of 19X reduction of error but also
significantly boosts the simulation process by up to 598X speedup.

Result: LoRAM在保持高效的同时，性能匹配或优于光谱初始化。

Conclusion: 更新幅度是LoRA性能的关键驱动因素，LoRAM提供了一种高效且性能优越的初始化策略。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient paradigm for tuning
large models. While recent spectral initialization methods improve convergence
and performance over the naive "Noise & Zeros" scheme, their extra
computational and storage overhead undermines efficiency. In this paper, we
establish update magnitude as the fundamental driver of LoRA performance and
propose LoRAM, a magnitude-driven "Basis & Basis" initialization scheme that
matches spectral methods without their inefficiencies. Our key contributions
are threefold: (i) Magnitude of weight updates determines convergence. We prove
low-rank structures intrinsically bound update magnitudes, unifying
hyperparameter tuning in learning rate, scaling factor, and initialization as
mechanisms to optimize magnitude regulation. (ii) Spectral initialization
succeeds via magnitude amplification. We demystify that the presumed
knowledge-driven benefit of the spectral component essentially arises from the
boost in the weight update magnitude. (iii) A novel and compact initialization
strategy, LoRAM, scales deterministic orthogonal bases using pretrained weight
magnitudes to simulate spectral gains. Extensive experiments show that LoRAM
serves as a strong baseline, retaining the full efficiency of LoRA while
matching or outperforming spectral initialization across benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决MoE模型在边缘设备上存储负担重的问题，通过分布式推理优化专家缓存。

Method: 针对Top-$K$专家选择策略，设计了贪婪算法（$K=1$）和动态规划方法（$K\geq1$），并引入最大卷积技术加速求解。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的存储和延迟问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: LPPO框架通过样本优化技术显著提升了RLVR的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently advanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While prior work
has emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we
investigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO
(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive
optimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best
leverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than
simply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human
problem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation
method that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations
to guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances. Second, inspired
by how humans focus on important questions aligned with their current
capabilities, we introduce learning-progress weighting, a dynamic strategy that
adjusts each training sample's influence based on model progression. We
estimate sample-level learning progress via an exponential moving average of
per-sample pass rates, promoting samples that foster learning and
de-emphasizing stagnant ones. Experiments on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines, yielding faster
convergence and a higher performance ceiling.

Abstract: Environments with controllable dynamics are usually understood in terms of
explicit models. However, such models are not always available, but may
sometimes be learned by exploring an environment. In this work, we investigate
using an information measure called "predicted information gain" to determine
the most informative regions of an environment to explore next. Applying
methods from reinforcement learning allows good suboptimal exploring policies
to be found, and leads to reliable estimates of the underlying controllable
dynamics. This approach is demonstrated by comparing with several myopic
exploration approaches.

Result: 在5G基准测试中，吞吐量和频谱效率提升显著，尤其在高速移动场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI原生的6G RAN提供了一种通用化解决方案，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Modern RAN operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, where
hand-tuned, rule-based RRM algorithms often underperform. While RL can surpass
such heuristics in constrained settings, the diversity of deployments and
unpredictable radio conditions introduce major generalization challenges.
Data-driven policies frequently overfit to training conditions, degrading
performance in unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose a
generalization-centered RL framework for RAN control that: (i) encodes cell
topology and node attributes via attention-based graph representations; (ii)
applies domain randomization to broaden the training distribution; and (iii)
distributes data generation across multiple actors while centralizing training
in a cloud-compatible architecture aligned with O-RAN principles. Although
generalization increases computational and data-management complexity, our
distributed design mitigates this by scaling data collection and training
across diverse network conditions. Applied to downlink link adaptation in five
5G benchmarks, our policy improves average throughput and spectral efficiency
by ~10% over an OLLA baseline (10% BLER target) in full-buffer MIMO/mMIMO and
by >20% under high mobility. It matches specialized RL in full-buffer traffic
and achieves up to 4- and 2-fold gains in eMBB and mixed-traffic benchmarks,
respectively. In nine-cell deployments, GAT models offer 30% higher throughput
over MLP baselines. These results, combined with our scalable architecture,
offer a path toward AI-native 6G RAN using a single, generalizable RL agent.

Conclusion: 新框架在解缠和生成质量上表现优异，支持潜在空间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

Result: 实验表明，CTPG显著提升了在操作和运动基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: CTPG是一种通用框架，可与现有参数共享方法结合，有效提升多任务强化学习性能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning endeavors to efficiently leverage shared
information across various tasks, facilitating the simultaneous learning of
multiple tasks. Existing approaches primarily focus on parameter sharing with
carefully designed network structures or tailored optimization procedures.
However, they overlook a direct and complementary way to exploit cross-task
similarities: the control policies of tasks already proficient in some skills
can provide explicit guidance for unmastered tasks to accelerate skills
acquisition. To this end, we present a novel framework called Cross-Task Policy
Guidance (CTPG), which trains a guide policy for each task to select the
behavior policy interacting with the environment from all tasks' control
policies, generating better training trajectories. In addition, we propose two
gating mechanisms to improve the learning efficiency of CTPG: one gate filters
out control policies that are not beneficial for guidance, while the other gate
blocks tasks that do not necessitate guidance. CTPG is a general framework
adaptable to existing parameter sharing approaches. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that incorporating CTPG with these approaches significantly
enhances performance in manipulation and locomotion benchmarks.

Motivation: 医学图像分类中数据泄漏问题严重，现有方法（如差分隐私）在大型数据集上有效，但在小规模不平衡数据集（如HAM10000）上表现不佳，导致模型陷入次优解。

Method: 提出SAD-DPSGD，采用线性衰减机制动态调整噪声和裁剪阈值，初始阶段分配更多隐私预算和更高裁剪阈值，避免信息丢失。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集上，SAD-DPSGD优于Auto-DPSGD，在隐私预算ε=3.0、δ=10^-3下准确率提升2.15%。

Conclusion: SAD-DPSGD有效解决了医学图像分类中的隐私保护问题，尤其适用于小规模不平衡数据集。

Abstract: When applying machine learning to medical image classification, data leakage
is a critical issue. Previous methods, such as adding noise to gradients for
differential privacy, work well on large datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-100, but
fail on small, imbalanced medical datasets like HAM10000. This is because the
imbalanced distribution causes gradients from minority classes to be clipped
and lose crucial information, while majority classes dominate. This leads the
model to fall into suboptimal solutions early. To address this, we propose
SAD-DPSGD, which uses a linear decaying mechanism for noise and clipping
thresholds. By allocating more privacy budget and using higher clipping
thresholds in the initial training phases, the model avoids suboptimal
solutions and enhances performance. Experiments show that SAD-DPSGD outperforms
Auto-DPSGD on HAM10000, improving accuracy by 2.15% under $\epsilon = 3.0$ ,
$\delta = 10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: UniOD避免了模型选择和超参数调优的麻烦，降低了计算成本，并有效利用历史数据集知识，提升了实际应用的便利性和准确性。

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) seeks to distinguish inliers and outliers in
completely unlabeled datasets and plays a vital role in science and
engineering. Most existing OD methods require troublesome dataset-specific
hyperparameter tuning and costly model training before they can be deployed to
identify outliers. In this work, we propose UniOD, a universal OD framework
that leverages labeled datasets to train a single model capable of detecting
outliers of datasets from diverse domains. Specifically, UniOD converts each
dataset into multiple graphs, produces consistent node features, and frames
outlier detection as a node-classification task, and is able to generalize to
unseen domains. As a result, UniOD avoids effort on model selection and
hyperparameter tuning, reduces computational cost, and effectively utilizes the
knowledge from historical datasets, which improves the convenience and accuracy
in real applications. We evaluate UniOD on 15 benchmark OD datasets against 15
state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline multi-task reinforcement learning aims to learn a unified policy
capable of solving multiple tasks using only pre-collected task-mixed datasets,
without requiring any online interaction with the environment. However, it
faces significant challenges in effectively sharing knowledge across tasks.
Inspired by the efficient knowledge abstraction observed in human learning, we
propose Goal-Oriented Skill Abstraction (GO-Skill), a novel approach designed
to extract and utilize reusable skills to enhance knowledge transfer and task
performance. Our approach uncovers reusable skills through a goal-oriented
skill extraction process and leverages vector quantization to construct a
discrete skill library. To mitigate class imbalances between broadly applicable
and task-specific skills, we introduce a skill enhancement phase to refine the
extracted skills. Furthermore, we integrate these skills using hierarchical
policy learning, enabling the construction of a high-level policy that
dynamically orchestrates discrete skills to accomplish specific tasks.
Extensive experiments on diverse robotic manipulation tasks within the
MetaWorld benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GO-Skill.

Abstract: This document reports on a method for detecting and preventing overfitting on
data regressions, herein applied to mesh-like data structures. The mesh
structure allows for the straightforward computation of the Laplace-operator
second-order derivatives in a finite-difference fashion for noiseless data.
Derivatives of the training data are computed on the original training mesh to
serve as a true label of the entropy of the training data. Derivatives of the
trained data are computed on a staggered mesh to identify oscillations in the
interior of the original training mesh cells. The loss of the Laplace-operator
derivatives is used for hyperparameter optimisation, achieving a reduction of
unwanted oscillation through the minimisation of the entropy of the trained
model. In this setup, testing does not require the splitting of points from the
training data, and training is thus directly performed on all available
training points. The Laplace operator applied to the trained data on a
staggered mesh serves as a surrogate testing metric based on diffusion
properties.

Abstract: Estimating individual-level treatment effect from observational data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference and has attracted increasing attention
in the fields of education, healthcare, and public policy.In this work, we
concentrate on the study of disentangled representation methods that have shown
promising outcomes by decomposing observed covariates into instrumental,
confounding, and adjustment factors. However, most of the previous work has
primarily revolved around generative models or hard decomposition methods for
covariates, which often struggle to guarantee the attainment of precisely
disentangled factors. In order to effectively model different causal
relationships, we propose a novel treatment effect estimation algorithm that
incorporates a mixture of experts with multi-head attention and a linear
orthogonal regularizer to softly decompose the pre-treatment variables, and
simultaneously eliminates selection bias via importance sampling re-weighting
techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on both public semi-synthetic and
real-world production datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate
that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods focused on
individual treatment effects.

Abstract: Fuzzy systems are a way to allow machines, systems and frameworks to deal
with uncertainty, which is not possible in binary systems that most computers
use. These systems have already been deployed for certain use cases, and fuzzy
systems could be further improved as proposed in this paper. Such technologies
to draw inspiration from include machine learning and federated learning.
Machine learning is one of the recent breakthroughs of technology and could be
applied to fuzzy systems to further improve the results it produces. Federated
learning is also one of the recent technologies that have huge potential, which
allows machine learning training to improve by reducing privacy risk, reducing
burden on networking infrastructure, and reducing latency of the latest model.
Aspects from federated learning could be used to improve federated learning,
such as applying the idea of updating the fuzzy rules that make up a key part
of fuzzy systems, to further improve it over time. This paper discusses how
these improvements would be implemented in fuzzy systems, and how it would
improve fuzzy systems. It also discusses certain limitations on the potential
improvements. It concludes that these proposed ideas and improvements require
further investigation to see how far the improvements are, but the potential is
there to improve fuzzy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于异构图注意力网络的方法，用于多领域电力系统状态预测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统因可再生能源和分布式能源的引入而变得复杂，需要可靠的短期状态预测以确保稳定运行。现有图神经网络方法通常假设传感器关系同质且局限于单一物理领域，无法处理现实中的异质数据。

Method: 采用异构图注意力网络，建模同质领域内和异质领域间的传感器关系，特别针对液压和电气两个物理领域的不同时间动态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在归一化均方根误差上平均比传统基线方法提高了35.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多领域、多速率电力系统状态预测中表现出色，为解决异质数据问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable
operation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing
variability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these
systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict
their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control
decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.
Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges
for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a
promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state
forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor
networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate
information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are
designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are
typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts
their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly
encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy
conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous
Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both
homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among
sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -
which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on
average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its
effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更鲁棒、实用的IfO技术提供了有价值的见解，推动了可扩展行为学习的进展。

Abstract: Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn
behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement
learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the
need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However,
current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality
data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast,
this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to
learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning
can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based
imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to
transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and
the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established
methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning.

Conclusion: PINN-Obs在非线性系统状态估计中表现出高效、准确和适应性强的特点。

Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a critical challenge in
control and engineering applications, particularly when only partial and noisy
measurements are available. This paper introduces a novel Adaptive
Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Observer (PINN-Obs) for accurate state
estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional model-based observers,
which require explicit system transformations or linearization, the proposed
framework directly integrates system dynamics and sensor data into a
physics-informed learning process. The observer adaptively learns an optimal
gain matrix, ensuring convergence of the estimated states to the true system
states. A rigorous theoretical analysis establishes formal convergence
guarantees, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves uniform error
minimization under mild observability conditions. The effectiveness of PINN-Obs
is validated through extensive numerical simulations on diverse nonlinear
systems, including an induction motor model, a satellite motion system, and
benchmark academic examples. Comparative experimental studies against existing
observer designs highlight its superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Conclusion: MAD框架有望成为科学计算中物理信息机器智能的通用范式。

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.

Motivation: 非线性激活函数对学习非线性数据集至关重要，但现有函数如ELU、SiLU、RELU等在平滑性和梯度上存在局限性，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出平滑且具有非零梯度的Leaky Exponential Linear Unit，并引入扩散损失指标评估模型过拟合。

Result: 新激活函数在性能上优于现有函数，减少了过拟合和对模型参数的敏感性。

Conclusion: 平滑且非零梯度的激活函数能显著提升神经网络性能，扩散损失指标有效评估模型过拟合。

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at
improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established
knowledge that nonlinear ac.f.'s are required for learning nonlinear datasets.
This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further
impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and
sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f.'s such as
ELU or SiLU have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f.'s such as RELU and
Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved
performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with
non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also
proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of
overfitting.

Conclusion: 提出的框架避免了复杂的信息论项，提供了更实用的拓扑泛化界，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Providing generalization guarantees for stochastic optimization algorithms is
a major challenge in modern learning theory. Recently, several studies
highlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the
generalization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a
series of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the
generalization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from
topological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds
rely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in
specific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),
potentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we
seek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization
bounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce
a novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies
via proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing
notion of \textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \textit{trajectory stability},
we prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be
upper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the
trajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory
stability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental
evaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great
importance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately
forms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization
bounds.

Conclusion: 结论是该方法是有效的，能够稳定训练并适应多种约束和行为模态。

Abstract: This article introduces an imitation learning method for learning maximum
entropy policies that comply with constraints demonstrated by expert
trajectories executing a task. The formulation of the method takes advantage of
results connecting performance to bounds for the KL-divergence between
demonstrated and learned policies, and its objective is rigorously justified
through a connection to a probabilistic inference framework for reinforcement
learning, incorporating the reinforcement learning objective and the objective
to abide by constraints in an entropy maximization setting. The proposed
algorithm optimizes the learning objective with dual gradient descent,
supporting effective and stable training. Experiments show that the proposed
method can learn effective policy models for constraints-abiding behaviour, in
settings with multiple constraints of different types, accommodating different
modalities of demonstrated behaviour, and with abilities to generalize.

Abstract: Speech tokenization is crucial in digital speech processing, converting

This paper introduces a novel speech tokenizer with broad applicability across

Our method significantly enhances speech representation fidelity across diverse

Result: LIVAR在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，且与现有FL方法无缝集成。

Conclusion: LIVAR证明仅通过现有训练信号即可实现高效模型聚合，为联邦学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches
for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone
parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our
method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during
standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based
merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation
scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an
explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing
update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless
integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective
model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals,
establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在情感分布学习中表现优越。

Conclusion: HeLo框架有效提升了多模态情感分布学习的性能，为情感识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition has garnered increasing attention as it plays
a significant role in human-computer interaction (HCI) in recent years. Since
different discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with
single-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that
identifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.
However, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among
multiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic
emotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
emotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring
the heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data
and label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt
cross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal
transport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the
interaction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral
representations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a
learnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,
the learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated
with the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven
cross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.

Motivation: 现有RFT方法多为在线策略RL，未能充分利用历史数据，导致计算和时间成本高昂。

Method: 提出ReMix方法，包括混合策略近端策略梯度、KL凸约束和策略重生技术。

Result: ReMix在多个数学推理基准测试中表现优异，训练成本降低30至450倍。

Conclusion: ReMix为高效RFT提供了新思路，揭示了离线策略RL的潜在问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

Conclusion: 结合迭代方法和路径条件化，为高斯过程在大规模应用中的高效实现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware function
approximation and sequential decision-making. Unfortunately, their classical
formulation does not scale gracefully to large amounts of data and modern
hardware for massively-parallel computation, prompting many researchers to
develop techniques which improve their scalability. This dissertation focuses
on the powerful combination of iterative methods and pathwise conditioning to
develop methodological contributions which facilitate the use of Gaussian
processes in modern large-scale settings. By combining these two techniques
synergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems
of linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.
This drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to
significantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as
the main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.

Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in
chemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,
and drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation
and lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced
retrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits
generalization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising
alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that
overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In
this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers
both 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using
diffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional
generation process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion
Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates
topological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,
a transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral
dependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact
structures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through
sampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,
SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight
the effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the
challenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is
the first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D
generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态定价和首次价格拍卖等应用中，资源分配和上下文分布非平稳性的挑战。

Method: 设计了一种在线算法，利用置信边界预言机实现次线性遗憾，克服了无限状态空间的强化学习问题。

Result: 算法在T次情节中实现了次线性遗憾，并在某些设置下提供了改进的遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 该框架为上下文BwK文献提供了新的视角，特别是在未标记特征数据的情况下。

Abstract: We study an online setting, where a decision maker (DM) interacts with
contextual bandit-with-knapsack (BwK) instances in repeated episodes. These
episodes start with different resource amounts, and the contexts' probability
distributions are non-stationary in an episode. All episodes share the same
latent conversion model, which governs the random outcome contingent upon a
request's context and an allocation decision. Our model captures applications
such as dynamic pricing on perishable resources with episodic replenishment,
and first price auctions in repeated episodes with different starting budgets.
We design an online algorithm that achieves a regret sub-linear in $T$, the
number of episodes, assuming access to a \emph{confidence bound oracle} that
achieves an $o(T)$-regret. Such an oracle is readily available from existing
contextual bandit literature. We overcome the technical challenge with
arbitrarily many possible contexts, which leads to a reinforcement learning
problem with an unbounded state space. Our framework provides improved regret
bounds in certain settings when the DM is provided with unlabeled feature data,
which is novel to the contextual BwK literature.

*Wei Chen,Wanyang Gu,Linjun Peng,Ruichu Cai,Zhifeng Hao,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在水平和垂直联邦设置下通过高阶累积量学习因果结构的方法，解决了数据隐私保护和变量不完整导致的虚假因果关系问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦因果发现方法主要针对水平联邦设置，而实际中不同客户端可能包含不同变量，导致虚假因果关系。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过聚合客户端的高阶累积量信息构建全局估计，用于递归源识别，生成全局因果强度矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据上表现优异，能重建因果图并估计因果强度系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在水平和垂直联邦设置下均有效，解决了变量不完整导致的虚假因果关系问题。

Abstract: Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between
entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and
numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal
structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.
However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain
data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables
can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the
information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we
comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both
horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification
theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and
vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first
aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to
construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for
recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength
matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but
also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm
demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic
data and real-world data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态滑动窗口优化方法（RL-Window），用于处理多维数据流，显著提升了分类准确性、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据流（如IoT、金融市场）的高速度、无界性和复杂依赖性对传统固定窗口方法提出了挑战，需要动态适应能力。

Method: 将窗口大小选择建模为强化学习问题，使用Dueling DQN和优先经验回放，结合流特征（方差、相关性、时间趋势）学习自适应策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，RL-Window在分类准确性、漂移鲁棒性和计算效率上优于ADWIN和CNN-Adaptive等现有方法。

Conclusion: RL-Window具有高度适应性和稳定性，适用于实时应用，并通过扩展指标（如能效、延迟）进一步验证了其优势。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data streams, prevalent in applications like IoT, financial
markets, and real-time analytics, pose significant challenges due to their high
velocity, unbounded nature, and complex inter-dimensional dependencies. Sliding
window techniques are critical for processing such streams, but fixed-size
windows struggle to adapt to dynamic changes like concept drift or bursty
patterns. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based
approach to dynamically optimize sliding window sizes for multi-dimensional
data streams. By formulating window size selection as an RL problem, we enable
an agent to learn an adaptive policy based on stream characteristics, such as
variance, correlations, and temporal trends. Our method, RL-Window, leverages a
Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN) with prioritized experience replay to handle
non-stationarity and high-dimensionality. Evaluations on benchmark datasets
(UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Yahoo! Finance Stream) demonstrate that RL-Window outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like ADWIN and CNN-Adaptive in classification
accuracy, drift robustness, and computational efficiency. Additional
qualitative analyses, extended metrics (e.g., energy efficiency, latency), and
a comprehensive dataset characterization further highlight its adaptability and
stability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中交通标志识别易受对抗攻击影响，威胁驾驶安全，需提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 结合故障模式与影响分析（FMEA）评估安全风险，动态分配权重，采用三版本NVML系统测试对抗样本。

Result: 实验表明，NVML框架显著提升了系统在FGSM和PGD攻击下的鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: NVML框架有效增强了交通标志识别系统的安全性，适用于对抗环境。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is rapidly advancing as a key application of machine
learning, yet ensuring the safety of these systems remains a critical
challenge. Traffic sign recognition, an essential component of autonomous
vehicles, is particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise
driving safety. In this paper, we propose an N-version machine learning (NVML)
framework that integrates a safety-aware weighted soft voting mechanism. Our
approach utilizes Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess potential
safety risks and assign dynamic, safety-aware weights to the ensemble outputs.
We evaluate the robustness of three-version NVML systems employing various
voting mechanisms against adversarial samples generated using the Fast Gradient
Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Experimental
results demonstrate that our NVML approach significantly enhances the
robustness and safety of traffic sign recognition systems under adversarial
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习缺乏公平的激励机制，影响了参与积极性，需要一种方法来公平评估节点贡献。

Method: 设计了DICE方法，通过理论推导近似计算任意邻居跳数的影响力传播，结合数据、通信拓扑和损失曲率。

Result: DICE为选择合适合作者和识别恶意行为提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: DICE是首个在去中心化环境中估计数据影响力传播的方法，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Decentralized learning offers a promising approach to crowdsource data
consumptions and computational workloads across geographically distributed
compute interconnected through peer-to-peer networks, accommodating the
exponentially increasing demands. However, proper incentives are still in
absence, considerably discouraging participation. Our vision is that a fair
incentive mechanism relies on fair attribution of contributions to
participating nodes, which faces non-trivial challenges arising from the
localized connections making influence ``cascade'' in a decentralized network.
To overcome this, we design the first method to estimate \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{I}nfluence \textbf{C}ascad\textbf{E} (DICE) in a decentralized
environment. Theoretically, the framework derives tractable approximations of
influence cascade over arbitrary neighbor hops, suggesting the influence
cascade is determined by an interplay of data, communication topology, and the
curvature of loss landscape. DICE also lays the foundations for applications
including selecting suitable collaborators and identifying malicious behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基础模型是否通过序列预测真正理解深层领域结构，类似于开普勒预测行星运动后发现的牛顿力学。

Method: 开发了一种技术，通过生成合成数据集来评估基础模型的适应能力，测量其归纳偏差是否与世界模型一致。

Result: 基础模型在训练任务上表现优异，但在适应新任务时未能发展出与底层世界模型一致的归纳偏差，尤其是在轨道轨迹任务中未能应用牛顿力学。

Conclusion: 基础模型可能仅发展出任务特定的启发式方法，而未能实现泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在噪声监督数据下，PINNs有效降低经验风险的条件，填补了相关研究的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析证明了神经网络规模的下界，并结合实验验证了PINNs在噪声数据下的表现。

Result: 证明了网络参数数量与样本数及噪声方差的关系，并验证了PINNs在噪声下仍能实现低经验风险。

Conclusion: 研究为定量理解噪声环境下训练PINNs的参数需求奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are increasingly used to approximate
solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in high
dimensions. In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is
important to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.
However, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so
effectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for
the supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy
supervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk
$O(\eta)$ below $\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily
$d_N\log d_N\gtrsim N_s \eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$
is the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies
to the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled
noisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone
does not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show
empirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\sigma^2$
under such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the
Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE. Our findings lay the groundwork for
quantitatively understanding the parameter requirements for training PINNs in
the presence of noise.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and
calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to
concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data
reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work,
we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that
bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across
re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our
unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and
(2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary
(including worst-case) levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are
tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated
DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required
noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., more than 15pp
accuracy increase in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying
perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating
the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification,
attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在处理多视图时存在四个主要问题：目标冲突、视图交互建模不足、继承的局限性以及无法充分利用视图多样性。

Method: 提出了两种新损失函数：MV-InfoNCE（扩展InfoNCE以同时建模所有视图交互）和MV-DHEL（解耦对齐与均匀性并适应视图多样性）。

Result: 在ImageNet1K等数据集上，新方法显著优于现有多视图方法，并能扩展到多模态数据。MV-DHEL在五视图以上时有效缓解维度崩溃。

Conclusion: 新方法在多视图对比学习中实现了理论上的优化目标，并在实验中验证了其有效性，为多视图学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

Motivation: 隐私问题和监管限制阻碍了敏感EHR数据的共享和使用，需要生成合成数据集以支持研究和应用。

Method: RawMed采用基于文本的表示和压缩技术，最小化预处理，生成多表时间序列数据。

Result: 在开源EHR数据集上验证，RawMed在保真度和实用性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RawMed为合成EHR数据提供了高保真度和实用性的解决方案，支持更广泛的医疗研究。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究为扩散模型在逆问题中的表现提供了精确分析框架。

Abstract: Used as priors for Bayesian inverse problems, diffusion models have recently
attracted considerable attention in the literature. Their flexibility and high
variance enable them to generate multiple solutions for a given task, such as
inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring. However, several unresolved
questions remain about how well they perform. In this article, we investigate
the accuracy of these models when applied to a Gaussian data distribution for
deblurring. Within this constrained context, we are able to precisely analyze
the discrepancy between the theoretical resolution of inverse problems and
their resolution obtained using diffusion models by computing the exact
Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the diffusion model sampler
and the ideal distribution of solutions to the inverse problem. Our findings
allow for the comparison of different algorithms from the literature.

Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构预测模型依赖多重序列比对（MSA），但在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质上效果有限。PLAME旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PLAME引入预训练表示增强进化信息，采用保守-多样性损失提升生成质量，并提出新的MSA筛选方法和序列质量评估指标。

Result: 在AlphaFold2基准测试中，PLAME在低同源性和孤儿蛋白质上表现优异，并在AlphaFold3上持续改进。

Conclusion: PLAME不仅提升了预测性能，还能作为适配器结合ESMFold的速度实现AlphaFold2级精度。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction is essential for drug discovery and
understanding biological functions. While recent advancements like AlphaFold
have achieved remarkable accuracy, most folding models rely heavily on multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to boost prediction performance. This dependency
limits their effectiveness on low-homology proteins and orphan proteins, where
MSA information is sparse or unavailable. To address this limitation, we
propose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings
from pretrained protein language models. Unlike existing methods, PLAME
introduces pretrained representations to enhance evolutionary information and
employs a conservation-diversity loss to enhance generation quality.
Additionally, we propose a novel MSA selection method to effectively screen
high-quality MSAs and improve folding performance. We also propose a sequence
quality assessment metric that provides an orthogonal perspective to evaluate
MSA quality. On the AlphaFold2 benchmark of low-homology and orphan proteins,
PLAME achieves state-of-the-art performance in folding enhancement and sequence
quality assessment, with consistent improvements demonstrated on AlphaFold3.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MSA selection method, while
extensive case studies on various protein types provide insights into the
relationship between AlphaFold's prediction quality and MSA characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that PLAME can serve as an adapter achieving
AlphaFold2-level accuracy with the ESMFold's inference speed.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an alternative to
traditional supervised machine learning solutions by enabling rich
representations from unstructured and unlabeled data. However, CL and, more
broadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of
data and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and
efficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs
between model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how
different SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy
budgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations
under resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy
costs involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may
assist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve
competitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,
underscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.

Motivation: 现有语义缓存框架依赖单一嵌入模型表示查询，难以捕捉真实查询分布中的多样语义关系，限制了缓存效率。

Method: 采用集成嵌入方法，结合多个嵌入模型并通过训练元编码器优化语义相似性检测。使用QQP数据集评估缓存命中率、未命中率、令牌节省和响应时间。

Result: 集成方法在语义等价查询上实现92%的缓存命中率，同时85%准确率拒绝非等价查询，显著优于单模型方法。

Conclusion: 集成嵌入方法能更有效区分语义相似与不相似查询，提升LLM缓存性能并降低计算开销。

Abstract: Semantic caching enhances the efficiency of large language model (LLM)
systems by identifying semantically similar queries, storing responses once,
and serving them for subsequent equivalent requests. However, existing semantic
caching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,
which limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships
present in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble
embedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained
meta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.
We evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring
cache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our
ensemble approach achieves a 92\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent
queries while maintaining an 85\% accuracy in correctly rejecting
non-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble
embedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in
distinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to
more effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in
LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: DCE框架有效解决了DIL中的关键挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

*Martin Marek,Sanae Lotfi,Aditya Somasundaram,Andrew Gordon Wilson,Micah Goldblum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现小批量训练语言模型更稳定且高效，建议调整Adam超参数并避免梯度累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小批量训练语言模型的稳定性及其对超参数选择的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出调整Adam超参数的规则，并验证小批量（甚至批量大小为1）的训练效果。

Result: 小批量训练更稳定、鲁棒，且性能优于大批量训练，支持使用普通SGD。

Conclusion: 建议选择小批量训练并调整超参数，避免不必要的梯度累积。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model
pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which
trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch
size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,
other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small
batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for
scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch
sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter
choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch
sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,
even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these
results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and
setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient
accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas,
bottlenecked by inter-device bandwidth.

### [80] [Does Data Scaling Lead to Visual Compositional Generalization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07102)
*Arnas Uselis,Andrea Dittadi,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，组合泛化能力由数据多样性而非数据规模驱动，线性分解表示结构是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代视觉模型是否具备组合理解能力，以及数据规模和多样性对组合泛化的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验系统变化数据规模、概念多样性和组合覆盖率，评估预训练模型（DINO、CLIP）。

Result: 组合泛化由数据多样性驱动，线性分解表示结构实现高效泛化，预训练模型表现部分符合。

Conclusion: 强调构建多样性数据集和高效组合学习的表示结构的重要性。

Abstract: Compositional understanding is crucial for human intelligence, yet it remains
unclear whether contemporary vision models exhibit it. The dominant machine
learning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes
will improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional
generalization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that
systematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We
find that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere
data scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a
linearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into
additive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling
perfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained
models (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting
partial presence of this structure. Our work motivates stronger emphasis on
constructing diverse datasets for compositional generalization, and considering
the importance of representational structure that enables efficient
compositional learning. Code available at

*Neil Rathi,Dan Jurafsky,Kaitlyn Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在过度自信和依赖风险，且不同语言间表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在多语言环境中的安全性，特别是其校准不确定性和局限性的能力。

Method: 分析五种语言中LLM生成的认识标记分布，并测量用户依赖行为。

Result: LLMs在所有语言中均表现出过度自信，但不同语言间标记分布差异显著；用户对自信生成的依赖行为也存在跨语言差异。

Conclusion: 多语言校准面临挑战，需结合文化和语言背景进行模型安全性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

TL;DR: ETT方法通过高效微调短上下文Transformer模型的参数，以线性计算开销和恒定内存需求扩展上下文长度，提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时面临二次计算和内存开销的挑战，限制了其应用范围。

Method: ETT通过将输入上下文分块为重叠子序列，并在测试时高效微调模型参数，实现上下文长度的扩展。

Result: 在LongBench上，ETT将GPT-Large和Phi-2的上下文长度从1k扩展到32k，准确率提升30%。微调FFN的第二层比全微调更有效。

Conclusion: ETT提供了一种高效扩展Transformer模型上下文长度的方法，显著提升了模型在长序列任务中的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

Conclusion: “词作为分类器”模型为统一形式、分布和接地语义理论提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何评估分词器质量，扩展了MorphScore以支持更多语言，并发现形态对齐对模型性能影响有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词是语言建模的关键步骤，但如何有效评估分词器质量尚不明确，尤其是分词器是否保留语言上有意义的子词。

Method: 扩展MorphScore至70种语言，改进其灵活性，并通过下游任务性能与形态对齐分数的相关性进行分析。

Result: 形态对齐分数对模型性能的方差解释有限，表明形态对齐不足以衡量与模型性能相关的分词器质量。

Conclusion: 形态对齐并非衡量分词器质量的关键维度，需探索其他评估方法。

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

Motivation: 研究句法结构的数学形式化，尤其是头部、补足语、指示语等句法关系，以及它们在超岩浆结构和彩色操作ad中的表现。

Method: 使用超岩浆结构和彩色操作ad理论，将句法结构的生成与过滤形式化，并探讨了内部合并、阶段等句法规则。

Result: 证明了句法结构的生成可以通过彩色操作ad的过滤规则等价地描述为彩色合并的过程，并将多种句法规则统一为彩色操作ad的形式。

Conclusion: 通过超岩浆结构和彩色操作ad，论文为句法结构提供了一个统一的数学框架，涵盖了多种句法规则和关系。

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK是一种高效的长上下文推理方法，通过梯度更新轻量级适配器在测试时编码上下文，显著优于传统提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理中传统方法内存消耗大且效率低的问题。

Method: 采用嵌套优化循环（内循环编码上下文到低秩适配器，外循环学习使用适配器推理）的元训练方法。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优异，GPT-2性能提升90%，Qwen-2.5-0.5B提升27%。

Conclusion: PERK在推理时更高效，对复杂推理、长度外推和信息位置更鲁棒。

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好的复杂性和数据集的有限覆盖，奖励模型在分布偏移或对抗扰动下容易失效，而现有方法依赖先验知识，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出了一种不依赖偏好分布先验的方法，通过奖励引导的解码发现失败模式，并利用这些对抗样本改进奖励模型。

Result: 在Anthropic HH和PKU Beavertails数据集上，REFORM显著提升了鲁棒性，同时保持了奖励质量，并在下游策略训练中表现良好。

Conclusion: REFORM通过自我改进机制提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和对齐质量，消除了虚假相关性。

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Method: 采用字典学习和稀疏自编码器分解LLMs，提取单义特征并自动优化提示。

Result: 显著提升数学推理和隐喻检测等下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了LLMs的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

Motivation: 传统的手动主题编码方法耗时且难以捕捉全球政策话语的复杂性，而DETM可以高效处理高维数据。

Result: 模型揭示了政策重点从温室气体转向实施、技术合作、能力建设和全球协议。

Conclusion: DETM是分析政策话语演变的有效工具，未来可扩展至其他政策领域。

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Result: 在多模态基准上提升4.4%，视觉依赖任务提升8.0%，感知错误减少30.5%。

Conclusion: PAPO为视觉基础推理的RL框架奠定基础，实现感知与推理的深度整合。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

Conclusion: 该方法为时间归一化提供了一种新的解决方案，兼具实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Conclusion: 选择性门控、分层循环和可控遗忘是混合模型关键，推荐特定架构和比例以实现高效性能。

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合大型语言模型和专门技术的新方法，用于将英语双关语翻译成法语，旨在捕捉语言创造力和幽默，而非简单复制词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言双关语翻译的挑战，填补翻译研究与计算语言学之间的空白。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1）基于对比学习数据集的大型语言模型基线；2）结合语音-语义嵌入的引导思维链；3）多代理生成-判别框架。

Result: 在CLEF JOKER 2025竞赛中取得第一和第二名。

Conclusion: 该研究通过语言学技术推动了双关语翻译，深化了对语言模型处理语义模糊性和文化背景的理解。

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

*Zicong Tang,Shi Luohe,Zuchao Li,Baoyuan Qi,Guoming Liu,Lefei Zhang,Ping Wang*

TL;DR: SpindleKV是一种新型的KV缓存缩减方法，通过平衡浅层和深层的处理策略，解决了KV缓存冗余问题，并在实验中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在大语言模型推理中内存消耗巨大，现有方法在浅层缓存缩减上效果不足，且存在冗余。

Method: SpindleKV结合了基于注意力权重的深层缓存淘汰方法和基于码本的浅层替换方法，解决了GQA问题。

Result: 实验表明，SpindleKV在KV缓存缩减效果上优于基线方法，同时保持了模型性能。

Conclusion: SpindleKV有效平衡了浅层和深层的KV缓存缩减，为LLM推理系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

Motivation: 行为金融学中，LLMs与投资者决策对齐面临真实数据稀缺的挑战，SFT依赖大量真实数据带来高成本和隐私风险。

Method: 提出InvestAlign框架，利用理论解决方案生成高质量SFT数据集，替代复杂场景的真实数据。

Result: 实验显示，InvestAlign生成的数据训练LLMs参数收敛更快，InvestAgent模型在简单和复杂投资问题中更接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: InvestAlign是一种有前景的方法，可解决复杂投资问题并实现LLMs与投资者决策的对齐。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 研究人类与LLM互动中的事实、逻辑或结构错误（无效化），并探索如何通过网络模型提高可靠性。

Method: 开发了一个讨论网络的数学模型，定义四种无效化危害，并提出开源算法FOO实现同行评审。

Result: 仅依赖偏离真相和自我修复的网络会稳定在较低错误率；加入新造虚假会重现当前LLM的高错误率；引入同行评审可转向真相主导状态。

Conclusion: 可靠性源于将不完美模型连接成互相监督的网络，而非单一模型的完美化。

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

Motivation: 通过结合结构化知识和多模态生成，提升食品领域问答的可靠性和多样性。

Method: 构建包含大量食谱、食材、关系和图像的MMKG，生成QA对，并联合微调Meta LLaMA和Stable Diffusion模型。

Result: BERTScore提升16.2%，FID降低37.8%，CLIP对齐提升31.1%，图像重用准确率达94.1%。

Conclusion: 结构化知识与多模态生成的结合显著提升了食品QA的可靠性和多样性。

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

Motivation: 探索SSM层间表示共享的效率潜力，以提升序列建模的性能。

Method: 引入GMU机制，构建SambaY架构，结合Samba和YOCO的优势，并在跨解码器中共享内存状态。

Result: SambaY显著提升了解码效率，保持了线性预填充时间复杂度，并在长上下文任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GMU和SambaY架构在效率和性能上均优于基线模型，展示了大规模计算下的优越可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的高维嵌入在领域特定应用中可能过于通用或低效，需改进。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于或媲美专有LLM嵌入基线。

Conclusion: FuDoBa能有效生成高效且可解释的表示，适用于领域特定任务。

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 数据提取阶段资源密集，研究者希望通过在线大型语言模型（LLM）和审查协议提高效率。

Method: 使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet和审查协议对10个证据源进行数据提取，并评估其性能。

Result: 简单数据提取准确率高（83.3%和100%），复杂数据提取准确率低（9.6%和15.8%）。总体精度>90%，但召回率和F1分数较低。

Conclusion: 基于审查协议的方法需要更全面的性能评估，建议研究者在类似应用中评估并报告LLM表现。

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

Motivation: 研究动机是量化政治精英间的对立情绪，以更好地理解精英极化的动态。

Method: 利用AI分析议会演讲中政治家之间的互动，记录发言者与被提及者，并评估情绪温度，构建精英极化指数。

Result: 研究结果显示该指数能有效反映选举活动、政党危机等事件，并可用于欧盟范围内的长期数据分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究精英极化提供了新工具，未来可扩展至更广泛的时间和地域范围。

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本数据非结构化且分散，传统提示方法难以处理长文本和语义密集内容，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出CLI-RAG框架，采用分层分块策略和双阶段检索机制（全局阶段识别相关笔记类型，局部阶段提取高价值内容）。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上生成的结构化进展笔记，时序和语义对齐得分达87.7%，优于临床医生笔记的80.7%。

Conclusion: CLI-RAG框架在临床文本生成中表现出高效性和一致性，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

Result: 确定性和不确定性预测的层间概率轨迹高度一致，不确定性未显著影响推理动态。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，简单的不确定性检测方法可能不可行，并展示了可解释性方法在研究不确定性影响推理中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs

investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%

Conclusion: CE-Judge是一种高效、低成本的多语言评估方法，无需训练即可取得优异性能。

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

Result: DACP方法显著提升了sLLMs在目标领域的性能，同时保持了通用能力，为企业级部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: DACP方法为小型语言模型在商业应用中的部署提供了可行且高效的途径。

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有顺序和并行推理方法存在效率低或协调不足的问题，需设计更灵活的推理框架。

Method: 提出语义熵（SE）作为质量指标，动态控制推理过程。

Result: SE与准确性呈强负相关，能有效评估推理质量。

Conclusion: 协作推理框架结合SE，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于段落个体相关性重排序，难以满足复杂查询的信息需求。

Method: 提出SETR方法，通过Chain-of-Thought推理识别查询需求，并选择最优段落集合。

Result: 在多跳RAG基准测试中，SETR在答案正确性和检索质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SETR为RAG系统提供了一种高效且有效的段落选择替代方案。

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于或匹配现有方法，同时显著降低能耗。

Conclusion: SCoRE以高效、模块化和可扩展性成为现实世界关系抽取应用的理想选择。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

Motivation: GUI代理与个人设备紧密集成，但视觉定位可能引入安全漏洞，尤其是后门攻击，目前研究不足。

Method: 提出VisualTrap方法，通过注入毒化数据误导代理的视觉定位，验证漏洞。

Result: 实验显示，仅需5%毒化数据即可高效攻击，且攻击可泛化至下游任务和不同GUI环境。

Conclusion: GUI代理的视觉定位漏洞亟待研究，以应对后门攻击风险。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

Motivation: 在线学习和AI辅导的兴起使得导师策略对学生表现的影响受到关注，但预测导师策略的研究较少，因此需要探索现代大语言模型在此任务中的表现。

Method: 使用两个数学辅导对话数据集，测试Llama 3和GPT-4o模型在预测导师策略和学生表现方面的能力。

Result: 研究发现，即使是最先进的大语言模型也难以准确预测导师策略，但导师策略对学生表现有显著影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的方法来预测导师策略及其对学生表现的影响。

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

Result: SAGA在TCGBench上的检测率达到90.62%，验证器准确率为32.58%，比LiveCodeBench-v6高10.78%。

Conclusion: SAGA方法有效提升了测试用例的质量和覆盖率，为可靠的LLM代码评估和RLVR在代码生成中的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

Conclusion: RAG系统对查询扰动敏感，需优化查询质量以提高性能，提出的评估框架有助于系统性改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

Motivation: 解决在封闭数据集上独立训练模型参数并灵活整合的需求，同时尊重数据所有者的隐私和许可要求。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）架构，每个专家在封闭数据集上独立训练，通过域感知路由整合。

Result: 在31个下游任务中表现优异，平均相对提升41%，优于现有模型合并方法10.1%。

Conclusion: FlexOlmo为敏感数据行业提供了一种解决方案，既能利用封闭数据，又能尊重数据所有者的控制权。

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

### [125] [Unveiling the Underwater World: CLIP Perception Model-Guided Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06234)
*Jiangzhong Cao,Zekai Zeng,Xu Zhang,Huan Zhang,Chunling Fan,Gangyi Jiang,Weisi Lin*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CLIP感知损失模块和课程对比正则化的水下图像增强方法，以提升感知质量和内容恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在水下图像增强中忽视人类感知且缺乏解空间约束，导致增强图像感知质量下降或内容恢复不佳。

Method: 利用CLIP模型的视觉语义特征提取能力设计感知损失模块，并结合课程对比正则化优化增强图像的约束。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和泛化能力上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 结合CLIP感知和课程对比正则化能有效提升水下图像增强的感知质量和内容恢复效果。

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC框架通过全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，实现了跨模型和模态的统一概念空间，显著提升了概念对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同AI模型因独立表示导致的概念空间不兼容问题，提升跨模型可解释性。

Method: 采用全局TopK稀疏机制和跨重建损失，学习共享的稀疏潜在空间。

Result: 在Open Images上，Jaccard相似度达到0.80，比之前方法提升三倍以上。

Conclusion: SPARC实现了跨模型和模态的概念对齐，支持直接比较和实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

*Rushil Desai,Frederik Warburg,Trevor Darrell,Marissa Ramirez de Chanlatte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesSDF提出了一种新的概率框架，用于量化神经隐式SDF模型中的不确定性，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学模拟应用（如森林中的流体流动）需要精确的表面几何和不确定性量化，现有方法缺乏直接几何集成，导致不确定性图校准不佳。

Method: BayesSDF利用拉普拉斯近似，通过基于Hessian的度量量化局部表面不稳定性，实现高效、表面感知的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，BayesSDF在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，提供了与几何重建质量密切相关的可操作不确定性预测。

Conclusion: BayesSDF为不确定性感知的3D场景重建、模拟和机器人决策奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA框架通过结合语义增强特征提取器和交错局部视觉耦合，解决了多模态模型在分割和视觉理解中的不准确和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在分割和理解任务中存在不准确分割和幻觉理解的局限性，主要源于视觉理解能力弱和缺乏细粒度感知。

Method: 提出LIRA框架，包含语义增强特征提取器（SEFE）和交错局部视觉耦合（ILVC），分别提升分割准确性和减少幻觉理解。

Result: LIRA在分割和理解任务中达到最先进性能，并发现分割精度与语义相关性正相关。

Conclusion: LIRA通过结合视觉理解和分割的互补关系，有效解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation

systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,

and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注图像成本高昂且公开数据集稀缺，野火科学中训练分割模型面临挑战。

Method: CCPDA方法包括三步：识别火簇、集中技术聚焦火区核心、将处理后的火簇粘贴到目标图像。

Result: 实验表明，CCPDA显著提升了火类分割性能，优于其他增强方法。

Conclusion: CCPDA有效缓解了小规模标注数据集的训练难题，尤其在火类分割中表现突出。

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在常见损坏（如噪声、模糊等）下性能显著下降，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: AR2通过迭代修复策略，交替进行CAM引导的细化和标准微调，对齐干净与损坏图像的CAMs。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-C等标准损坏基准测试中，AR2表现优于现有方法，平衡了干净数据的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AR2为提升模型在多样化损坏环境中的可靠性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for

Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic

soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring

Result: 实验显示，方法实现最优性能，推理速度提高35倍，吞吐量达145 Hz。

Conclusion: VOTE框架高效且泛化能力强，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior
performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However,
their generalization remains limited when applied to novel objects or
unfamiliar environments that lie outside the training distribution. To address
this, many existing approaches integrate additional components such as depth
estimation, segmentation, or even diffusion to improve generalization, at the
cost of adding significant computation overhead, resulting in low efficiency.
This motivates the exploration of efficient action prediction methods, which
are independent of additional high-level visual representations or diffusion
techniques. In this work, we propose VOTE, an efficient and general framework
for the optimization and acceleration of VLA models. In details, we propose a
novel tokenizer-free fine-tuning approach for parallel accurate action
prediction, which reduces computational overhead and accelerates inference
speed. Additionally, we adopt an ensemble voting strategy for the action
sampling, which significantly improves model performance and enhances
generalization. Experimental results show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 35$\times$ faster inference and 145 Hz
throughput. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: PCL-Former通过模块化设计有效提升了时序动作定位任务的性能，验证了多阶段Transformer架构的潜力。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式相机在连续处理RGB图像时的高能耗、大数据量、隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Method: 通过低分辨率热成像数据识别手部活动转换，动态调整RGB帧采样率，并利用热线索定位感兴趣区域。

Result: 仅使用3%的原始RGB数据，实现了与完整视频相当的识别准确率（F1-score 95%）。

Conclusion: THOR为穿戴式相机在实时监测手部活动和健康风险行为方面提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了事件相机的实时性能，适用于低功耗、高速的边缘计算应用。

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中，Video-RTS仅使用3.6%的训练样本，平均准确率提升2.4%，在Video-Holmes和MMVU上分别提升4.2%和2.6%。

Conclusion: Video-RTS通过纯强化学习和自适应视频测试时间扩展策略的互补优势，实现了高效的视频推理性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

*Yuechen Xie,Haobo Jiang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Mask6D的新型预训练策略，通过结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，提升单目RGB图像在复杂或遮挡条件下的6D物体姿态估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前姿态估计网络在复杂场景中难以提取具有区分性的姿态感知特征，尤其是在目标被遮挡时RGB信息有限的情况下。

Method: 提出Mask6D预训练策略，结合2D-3D对应图和可见掩码图，设计对象聚焦的预训练损失函数，并通过常规姿态训练策略微调网络。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于之前的端到端姿态估计方法。

Conclusion: Mask6D通过引入额外的模态信息和对象聚焦的预训练策略，显著提升了复杂场景下的6D姿态估计性能。

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

*Yupeng Hu,Changxing Ding,Chang Sun,Shaoli Huang,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BC-HOI的双边协作框架，用于开放词汇HOI检测，通过ABG和LSG组件提升交互特征的细粒度表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的粗粒度特征，与检测任务的细粒度需求矛盾。

Method: BC-HOI框架包含ABG（引导VLM生成细粒度特征）和LSG（利用LLM提供细粒度监督）。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: BC-HOI框架有效解决了开放词汇HOI检测的细粒度特征问题。

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Abstract: Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have
significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To
facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey
systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in
traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks

taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups
that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories
and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related
fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the
analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and
visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The
cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the
aim of providing information on standards unification and resource
optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the
existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions
from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and
recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving
field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic
resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

Method: 提出FIFA框架，提取描述性事实，构建时空语义依赖图，利用VideoQA模型验证；并引入基于工具的Post-Correction修正框架。

Result: FIFA比现有评估方法更接近人类判断，Post-Correction有效提升了文本和视频生成的事实一致性。

Conclusion: FIFA和Post-Correction为VideoMLLMs的忠实性评估和修正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KSCU的新方法，专注于扩散模型的关键步骤以实现概念遗忘，平衡安全性与生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有概念遗忘方法在平衡遗忘效果与生成能力保留上的不足。

Method: KSCU方法利用扩散模型的逐步采样特性，针对关键步骤进行微调，减少参数更新。

Result: 实验证明KSCU能有效阻止不良图像生成，同时保留模型生成能力。

Conclusion: KSCU为文本到图像扩散模型的安全应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助聋哑和听力障碍者更轻松地沟通，填补了从语音到手语动画转换的研究空白。

Method: 使用Whisper将语音转为文本，MarianMT模型翻译为ASL gloss，结合Word2Vec和FastText优化翻译，最后通过3D关键点系统生成动画。

Result: 系统表现优异，BLEU分数达到0.7714和0.8923，并创建了新数据集Sign3D-WLASL和BookGlossCorpus-CG。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个从语音到手语动画的完整框架，整合了多种数据和技术，实现了更自然的动画效果。

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

Conclusion: ILNet通过动态建模和高效锚点选择，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和多模态分布能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了数据标注需求，提升了野生动物监测效率。

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Conclusion: ToBo能有效学习动态场景的时序表示，并具有可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Conclusion: Concept-TRAK通过概念级归因为生成AI的透明性和版权问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

Result: DSF在kNN分类和线性评估等任务中表现优异，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DSF无需温度超参数，理论证明其与余弦相似性的联系，并展示其优越性。

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数EBT，通过将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，优化边缘检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WBCE损失函数对所有非边缘像素一视同仁，忽略了结构差异，导致预测模糊。

Method: 提出EBT损失函数，将像素分为边缘、边界和纹理三类，并为每类分配不同的监督权重。

Result: 实验证明EBT损失在多个基准测试中表现优异，且超参数设置简单。

Conclusion: EBT损失函数在边缘检测任务中表现优越，易于部署。

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Result: MOST在文本到运动检索和生成上达到最先进水平，尤其在罕见提示上表现突出。

Conclusion: MOST通过细粒度匹配和消除冗余，显著提升了文本到运动生成的效果。

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: 自适应边界对比学习方法显著提升了3D语义分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Conclusion: DCS和EAFNet的组合有效解决了HDR视频重建中的闪烁问题，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跨模态双因果学习（CMDCL）方法，通过文本和视觉因果干预解决长时动作识别中的跨模态偏差和视觉混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时动作识别（LTAR）因时间跨度长、动作关联复杂及视觉混淆问题而具有挑战性。现有方法多依赖统计相关性而非因果机制，且缺乏跨模态因果建模。

Method: 提出CMDCL方法，通过结构因果模型揭示视频与标签文本间的因果关系，分别通过文本因果干预和视觉因果干预解决跨模态偏差和视觉混淆。

Result: 在Charades、Breakfast和COIN三个基准测试中验证了CMDCL的有效性。

Conclusion: CMDCL通过双因果干预生成鲁棒的动作表示，显著提升了长时动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

*Qing Zhang,Guoquan Pei,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Omni-Fuse的空间-光谱全融合网络，用于医学高光谱图像分割，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学高光谱成像（MHSI）在疾病诊断中潜力巨大，但高维度和光谱冗余特性使其信息融合具有挑战性。

Method: 设计了跨维度特征融合操作，包括双向注意力机制、光谱引导的空间查询选择和两阶段跨维度解码器。

Result: 在两个数据集上实验显示，DSC指标提升超过5.73%。

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse在高效执行的同时，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视点依赖投影（VDP）的点云分割方法，通过动态适应空间几何生成高效3D到2D映射，解决了现有方法因视点独立性导致的投影多样性和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投影方法因视点独立性限制了投影多样性，且多投影导致计算冗余。VDP旨在通过数据驱动投影和颜色正则化优化，提升投影效率和语义理解能力。

Method: 设计了VDP框架，通过数据驱动生成自适应投影射线，并引入颜色正则化优化特征提取，减少非语义信息干扰。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet基准测试中，PointVDP表现出色，计算成本低且结果具有竞争力。

Conclusion: PointVDP提供了一种资源高效的语义理解解决方案，通过动态投影和优化框架显著提升了点云分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习（SSL）方法在病理学中可能忽略复杂的领域特定特征，且数据效率低，需要大量计算资源。

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0通过幻灯片级监督学习补丁级表示，提高了数据效率和性能。

Result: 在10个生物标志物预测任务中，EXAONE Path 2.0实现了最先进的平均性能，仅需37k WSIs训练。

Conclusion: EXAONE Path 2.0展示了幻灯片级监督在病理学中的高效性和优越性。

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Motivation: 医学领域中，密集标注（如像素级）成本高且不现实，尤其是在新任务中。稀疏标注的学习能力可以推动研究进展。

Method: 将问题建模为稀疏热图回归，并提出新的损失函数Crag and Tail loss，有效利用稀疏标签并减少假阴性影响。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在稀疏标注下实现了准确的致癌关键点定位。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注稀缺的场景中具有潜力，能推动医学图像分析的研究。

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse
labels while minimizing the impact of false negatives or missed annotations.
Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

Conclusion: ClipGS在渲染质量和效率上显著提升，适用于医学数据的交互式电影化可视化。

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法通过度量学习实现跨模态特征对齐，但忽视了图像与点云数据之间的固有模态差距，导致跨模态对应关系不准确。

Method: 提出Diff$^2$I2P框架，利用扩散先验，结合CSD技术优化变换预测，并通过DCT模块实现可微分的对应关系估计和PnP求解。

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P通过扩散先验和可微分设计，有效解决了跨模态配准问题，为I2P配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Conclusion: CDR-CA任务和Multi-Source DPPs方法为结果多样化提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SPGD通过梯度管理技术有效解决了扩散模型中的不稳定性问题，提升了图像恢复性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average

Result: 压缩比达96.4%，渲染质量损失小（PSNR下降<1 dB），速度比现有方法快1.7-2.1倍。

Conclusion: FlexGaussian是一种高效、灵活的3D高斯压缩方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being
prepared and will be released soon at:

Conclusion: QUANet通过增强数量感知和优化解码器设计，显著提升了计数任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner通过结合LLM驱动的空间推理和分层特征场，有效解决了开放词汇3D视觉定位中的空间关系推理问题。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度工业场景（如半导体制造）缺乏专用数据集，阻碍了复杂过程建模和预测的研究。

Method: 构建CHDL数据集，并提出DIFFUMA模型，结合Mamba模块和扩散模块，优化时空预测。

Result: DIFFUMA在CHDL上表现优异，MSE降低39%，SSIM提升至0.988，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了SOTA模型，还为工业AI社区贡献了宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉与文本表示之间存在差异，伪注释和对比对齐策略能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分层特征提取（帧、片段、视频级）并与伪注释和口语对齐，结合对比学习。

Result: 实验显示方法提升了BLEU-4和ROUGE分数，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: 分层预训练策略有效提升手语翻译性能，为无注释方法提供新思路。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Motivation: 医学异常检测面临成像模态多样、解剖结构变化大和标记数据有限等挑战，需要更灵活的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了医学图像异常检测的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决现有SOTA模型在处理MRI多视角（轴向、冠状、矢状面）时性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出FOLC-Net，结合MRFO优化、全局模型克隆和ConvNeXt，参数仅1.217M，存储需求0.9MB。

Result: 在矢状面准确率达92.44%，优于其他模型（88.37%和88.95%），多视角下表现稳健。

Conclusion: FOLC-Net为分散式医疗图像分析提供了更可靠、适应性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像融合旨在整合多模态互补信息以提升高级视觉任务性能，但现有方法在长程特征依赖建模和互补特征捕获方面存在计算成本高和缺乏真实数据的挑战。

Method: RPFNet采用双分支框架：残差先验模块（RPM）提取模态差异信息，频域融合模块（FDFM）通过频域卷积实现全局特征建模。交叉促进模块（CPM）增强局部与全局特征协同感知。训练中引入辅助解码器和显著性结构损失。

Result: 实验表明RPFNet能有效整合判别性特征，增强纹理细节和显著目标，提升高级视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: RPFNet通过频域建模和残差先验驱动，解决了图像融合中的计算和特征捕获难题，显著提升了融合效果。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示复杂度的自适应缓存方法（PCA缓存），通过动态调整重用阈值和优化输入输出关系建模，显著提升了视频生成的推理速度，同时保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成中的推理速度是主要瓶颈，固定频率的缓存机制在复杂场景下质量下降明显，手动调整阈值效率低且不鲁棒。

Method: 提出PCA缓存，根据输入提示估计场景复杂度动态调整重用阈值；改进TeaCache的输入输出关系建模；引入动态CFGCache机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在Wan2.1模型上实现了2.79倍的加速，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PCA缓存和动态CFGCache机制有效解决了视频生成中的速度与质量权衡问题。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为语音手势视频生成研究提供了高效且公开的资源。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了跨模态匹配的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为文本到人物图像匹配提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes

Result: D2I在多个基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D2I展示了规则奖励对提升多模态LLM推理能力的作用，并启发了训练与测试推理方式的解耦。

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

*Subrat Kishore Dutta,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAP是一种新型对抗补丁攻击框架，通过感知感知定位和扰动优化生成高度隐形的对抗补丁，显著提升攻击成功率和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标攻击场景下表现不佳或生成的补丁缺乏上下文连贯性，容易被人类或自动防御系统检测到。

Method: IAP结合类定位和敏感度图选择补丁位置，并采用感知正则化对抗损失和颜色恒常性梯度更新规则优化扰动。

Result: 实验表明IAP在目标攻击中具有高成功率，且补丁隐蔽性显著优于现有基线，同时能绕过多种先进防御系统。

Conclusion: IAP在对抗补丁攻击中实现了高效性和隐蔽性的平衡，为对抗防御提供了新挑战。

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖外部模块生成伪分割掩码，本工作旨在直接利用ViT的自注意力图，提升效率和准确性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，生成的伪掩码可用于训练分割模型，接近全监督模型效果。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了细粒度标注需求，提升了弱监督语义分割的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

Abstract: This study presents findings from long-term biometric evaluations conducted
at the Biometric Evaluation Center (bez). Over the course of two and a half
years, our ongoing research with over 400 participants representing diverse
ethnicities, genders, and age groups were regularly assessed using a variety of
biometric tools and techniques at the controlled testing facilities. Our
findings are based on the General Data Protection Regulation-compliant local

multiple biometric modalities such as face and finger. We used state-of-the-art
face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores. Our results
show that these scores fluctuate more significantly between individual days
than over the entire measurement period. These findings highlight the
importance of testing biometric characteristics of the same individuals over a
longer period of time in a controlled measurement environment and lays the
groundwork for future advancements in biometric data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要准确的场景理解，但摄像头和LiDAR在恶劣天气下表现不佳，且无法直接提供运动信息。雷达虽能克服这些限制，但其数据稀疏且噪声较大。

Method: SemRaFiner通过优化稀疏雷达点云的特征提取，并结合专门的数据增强技术改进实例分配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在雷达泛光分割任务上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SemRaFiner为基于雷达的场景理解提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法依赖DINO的全局表示，导致区分性和泛化性之间存在固有折衷。APL旨在通过自适应部分发现和学习解决这一问题。

Method: APL利用共享可学习部分查询和DINO部分先验生成一致对象部分，并提出all-min对比损失学习区分性和泛化性强的部分表示。

Result: APL在细粒度数据集上表现出显著性能提升，可轻松集成到不同GCD框架中。

Conclusion: APL通过自适应部分学习和对比损失，有效平衡了区分性和泛化性，为GCD任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中国书法字符的属性信息（如风格、朝代和书法家）具有重要文化和历史价值，但现有数据集稀缺且缺乏多属性标注，限制了深入研究。

Method: 构建了包含7,765类、329,715个书法字符图像的MCCD数据集，并提取了基于脚本风格、朝代和书法家的三个子集。

Result: 实验表明，书法字符的笔画结构复杂性和多属性交互显著增加了识别的难度。

Conclusion: MCCD填补了详细书法数据集的空白，为多领域研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 古代人类通过管理植被促进棕榈树增殖，留下持久生态足迹，揭示了人工智能与生态考古数据结合在识别人类环境互动中的潜力。

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）存在幻觉问题，影响可靠性。传统偏好优化方法面临临床无关样本、数据分布不平衡和专家标注成本高等挑战。

Method: 提出CheXPO策略：1）合成多任务胸部X射线视觉指令数据集进行监督微调（SFT）；2）通过置信度分析和相似性检索扩展困难样本；3）利用合成反事实推理提供细粒度临床偏好。

Result: CheXPO仅用5%的SFT样本实现8.93%性能提升，达到多种临床任务的最优性能。

Conclusion: CheXPO为放射学应用提供可扩展、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

Motivation: 在MR引导自适应放疗中，准确的图像配准对于轮廓传播和剂量累积至关重要，因此需要一种能够适应不同领域（如不同磁场强度）的配准方法。

Method: 研究采用了一种逐步优化的配准和分割方法（ProRSeg），利用加权分割一致性损失训练模型，并在相同领域、跨领域和混合领域的数据集上测试其性能。

Conclusion: ProRSeg在多领域MR-MR配准中表现出合理的性能，并初步验证了其在评估治疗合规性方面的可行性。

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

Result: 生成图像在无参考质量指标上优于原始拼接图像，并提升下游感知模型性能。

Conclusion: Percep360为自动驾驶提供了高质量、可控的全景数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在放射学报告生成中难以准确映射病理和解剖特征到文本描述，且特征提取缺乏语义关联，阻碍了临床采用。

Method: MCA-RG使用病理和解剖概念库对齐视觉特征，提出基于解剖的对比学习和匹配损失优化特征，并采用特征门控机制过滤低质量特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus基准测试中，MCA-RG表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-RG通过知识驱动的方法显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

Result: 在15个跨域和分布外数据集上，FreeTTA表现稳定且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeTTA为测试时适应提供了一种灵活且高效的新范式，无需训练或历史数据假设。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

### [197] [DenoiseCP-Net: Efficient Collective Perception in Adverse Weather via Joint LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection and Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06976)
*Sven Teufel,Dominique Mayer,Jörg Gamerdinger,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DenoiseCP-Net的多任务架构，用于恶劣天气下的LiDAR集体感知，通过去噪和物体检测的统一设计，减少了带宽需求和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在恶劣天气下感知系统易受传感器性能下降的影响，集体感知技术尚未充分研究此类场景。

Method: 提出DenoiseCP-Net，结合体素级去噪和物体检测，使用稀疏卷积骨干网络，避免冗余计算。

Result: 在模拟恶劣天气的OPV2V数据集上，DenoiseCP-Net实现了高去噪精度，带宽需求减少23.6%，同时保持检测精度和降低延迟。

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net为恶劣天气下的集体感知提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

*Yulin An,Enrique del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于几何深度学习的框架，用于高效预测CAD网格的Laplace-Beltrami谱，显著节省计算时间且保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法（FEM）计算Laplace-Beltrami谱的效率低，尤其在处理大规模CAD机械部件数据库或频繁质量检测时。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合高斯曲率、平均曲率和主曲率等丰富网格特征，训练模型预测Laplace-Beltrami谱。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比线性FEM快约5倍，同时保持竞争性准确性。

Conclusion: Laplace-Beltrami谱是可学习的，几何深度学习为高效计算提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap优于现有方法，为病理诊断提供高效可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

Conclusion: 该方法为从H&E图像中高效预测细胞组成提供了可行的解决方案，避免了昂贵的空间转录组学实验。

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

Conclusion: MST-Distill通过动态教师模型和掩码模块有效解决了知识漂移和路径选择问题，提升了跨模态知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过整合上下文元数据（如GPS位置、时间戳和食物种类）提升大型多模态模型（LMMs）在营养分析中的表现，并展示了其对推理修饰符的增强效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估专有模型（如GPT-4），而忽略了广泛的LMMs，且上下文元数据及其与推理修饰符的交互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过整合GPS坐标、时间戳和食物种类等元数据，结合多种推理修饰符（如思维链、多模态思维链等），评估了八种LMMs在营养分析中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，智能整合元数据能显著降低营养值预测的平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的LMMs在营养分析中具有显著潜力，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

Motivation: 准确将像素测量转换为真实世界尺寸是计算机视觉中的基础挑战，限制了生物医学、法医学、营养分析和电子商务等关键应用的发展。

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

Result: 在新数据集上，L-VQAScore在与人评估的相关性上优于现有方法，能捕捉细粒度实体-属性关联。

Conclusion: L-VQAScore是一种可靠且可扩展的评估方法，有望替代主观评估。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Method: 结合预训练视觉编码器、文本到图像扩散模型的解码器和大型语言模型，通过信息瓶颈和知识蒸馏构建VLV框架。

Result: 模型在低成本（<1000美元）下达到与GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的描述性能。

Conclusion: VLV框架通过高效利用预训练模型，显著降低了构建高性能视觉语言模型的成本和数据需求。

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at

core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration

paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and

NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
