*Sishi Xiong,Dakai Wang,Yu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Changzai Pan,Haowei He,Xiangyu Li,Wenhan Chang,Zhongjiang He,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型和编程的表推理框架TableReasoner，用于解决表问答任务中的挑战，并在SemEval-2025 Task 8中取得第一名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表问答任务面临真实世界表格数据的挑战，如规模大、列语义不完整和实体歧义。

Method: 提出TableReasoner框架，结合结构和语义表示建模表格，设计多步模式链接计划以聚焦查询相关信息，并集成迭代思考架构。

Result: 系统在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均取得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合语义和结构表示以及迭代推理，有效解决了表问答任务中的挑战。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态Stackelberg博弈框架，用于建模LLM越狱中的攻防交互，并提出了结合对抗探索和防御策略的“紫色代理”解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需要有效防御方法。

Method: 采用动态Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展形式博弈，提出“紫色代理”结合RRT进行对抗探索和防御。

Result: “紫色代理”能主动模拟攻击轨迹并干预，为分析对抗动态和降低越狱风险提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM安全提供了一种原则性方法，能有效应对越狱攻击。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Nash框架通过游戏理论模型研究LLM驱动的决策，引入提示空间均衡，区别于经典纳什均衡，关注有限理性和认知约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在决策中的有限理性行为，探索提示选择对策略交互的影响。

Method: 提出LLM-Nash框架，将均衡定义在提示空间，通过LLM推理生成行为。

Result: 展示推理均衡与经典纳什均衡的差异，为LLM系统策略交互提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为理解有限理性和认知约束下的策略交互提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了智能体如何在探索（好奇心）与控制（能力）之间取得平衡，通过比较两种模型（Tabular和Dreamer）揭示了探索与表征学习的互动关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体如何平衡好奇心（寻求知识）与能力（控制环境），以理解内在动机与强化学习的结合。

Method: 比较了两种模型：基于手工状态抽象的Tabular代理和基于内部世界模型学习的Dreamer代理。

Result: Tabular代理显示好奇心和能力引导探索的不同模式，而Dreamer代理揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。

Conclusion: 研究形式化了适应性探索的平衡，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [6] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 解决现有神经符号方法中逻辑接地过程导致的组合爆炸或缺乏理论保证的问题。

Method: 提出一种参数化的接地方法，基于广义反向链，灵活控制接地过程。

Result: 实验表明接地标准的选择对神经符号方法的性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法在表达性与可扩展性之间提供了有效权衡。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [7] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态量子联邦学习方法，通过量子纠缠实现中间融合，并引入缺失模态无关机制（MMA）以提升模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量子联邦学习框架多为单模态，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求。

Method: 采用多模态量子联邦学习框架，结合量子纠缠进行中间融合，并设计MMA机制以处理缺失模态问题。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态量子联邦学习方法有效提升了模型性能，MMA机制解决了缺失模态带来的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

### [9] [Abductive Computational Systems: Creative Abduction and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08264)
*Abhinav Sood,Kazjon Grace,Stephen Wan,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文综述了溯因推理在不同领域的讨论，并分析了计算系统中的应用，指出当前理论和计算实现均未能充分支持创造性假设的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在理论和计算系统中的表现，尤其是其在创造性假设生成方面的不足。

Method: 通过文献综述和分析计算系统的实现方式，分解溯因推理的组成部分。

Result: 发现理论和计算系统均未有效支持创造性溯因假设的生成。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以推动计算系统中创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

### [10] [Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270)
*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的安全对齐框架，用于处理使用工具的LLM代理的安全风险，通过结构化推理和沙盒强化学习应对用户和工具的双重威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着能够使用工具的自主LLM代理的出现，传统对话滥用之外的安全风险也随之增加，需要新的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出了一个三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感）和策略驱动的决策模型，并设计了一个沙盒环境进行细粒度奖励塑造。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐的代理显著提高了对安全威胁的抵抗力，同时保持了良性任务的强实用性。

Conclusion: 安全性和有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，提升了多模态大语言模型在动态空间交互中的推理能力，并在8个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 构建高质量数据管道（294.2K样本）；2. 动态多任务训练策略与任务特定奖励。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，尤其在通用和空间推理领域表现优异。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练创新，显著提升了模型的动态空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [12] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理的框架，用于自动生成伦理需求草稿，并通过案例研究验证其有效性，同时指出仍需人工反馈以提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于时间和资源限制，手动获取伦理需求具有挑战性且优先级低，因此需要一种自动化方法来促进伦理需求的生成。

Method: 在多智能体LLM环境中引入伦理倡导代理，通过批判系统描述中的伦理问题生成需求草稿。

Result: 框架在案例研究中捕获了大部分人工访谈识别的伦理需求，并引入了额外相关需求，但也存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推动伦理需求工程的广泛应用，但仍需结合人工反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

### [14] [From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501)
*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层框架，将自然语言映射到逻辑表示，通过任务抽象和逻辑生成两阶段实现，显著提升了推理准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入的结构化推理问题，弥合非结构化语言表达与形式逻辑表示之间的差距。

Method: 采用双层框架，上层通过大语言模型（LLM）将自然语言解析为结构化中间表示，下层生成符号化工作流或可执行推理程序。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率显著提升，最高达40%，同时增强了透明度和错误可追溯性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM的可信和系统性推理提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断受限于知识表示深度不足、概念理解有限和临床推理能力不足。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医疗概念，结合分层知识图谱（分类、临床特征、实例），并使用四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。专家评估显示信息质量、推理和专业表达均有改善。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了罕见病患者的诊断周期，接近临床阈值。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用多模态大模型（LMM）自动地理参考生物样本记录的新方法，通过视觉化空间关系显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考样本记录的高劳动强度问题，现有方法未充分利用地图信息。

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估了结构化多代理系统（MAS）在早期工程设计中的表现，发现其在设计细节上优于双代理系统（2AS），但需求覆盖率和代码兼容性仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期工程设计需要复杂的迭代推理，现有的大语言模型（LLM）工作流难以保持任务连续性和生成可执行模型。

Method: 通过比较九角色MAS和双代理2AS在太阳能水过滤系统设计中的表现，使用Design-State Graph（DSG）作为设计状态的JSON可序列化表示。

Result: MAS在设计细节上更优，但需求覆盖率低于20%，代码兼容性平均低于50%；推理蒸馏模型能可靠标记工作流完成。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理协调提升了设计细节，但需求覆盖和代码兼容性仍需改进。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2是一个7B参数的大型语言模型，用于生成Lean 4中的形式化定理证明，通过验证器集成的长链思维（CoT）和强化学习（RL）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步提升模型性能，特别是通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我感知并纠正推理错误。

Method: 采用验证器反馈的强化学习，结合反馈令牌掩码和简单奖励策略，优化多轮验证器交互的推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为INoT的新型AI代理推理框架，通过设计新的LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能够执行程序化对话推理，从而降低推理成本并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs进行推理，但受限于其固有语言理解能力和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了一种新的LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能够执行程序化对话推理，实现自省和反思。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的推理能力和效率，并展示了在图像任务中的通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text
input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦少样本学习框架，结合隐私保护机制，解决呼吸疾病诊断中数据标注不足和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据标注劳动密集且隐私问题阻碍数据共享，传统方法依赖大量数据且可能泄露隐私。

Method: 采用元随机梯度下降算法防止过拟合，并引入高斯差分隐私噪声保护梯度，使用加权平均算法聚合模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在隐私保护下有效诊断呼吸疾病，适应不同数据结构和分布。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限和隐私保护需求下，为呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Motivation: 组合优化在TPE中尚未被充分研究，但在化学和生物学等领域有重要应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 泛化TPE中的分类核与数值核，引入距离结构，并优化核计算的时间复杂度以处理大规模组合搜索空间。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在合成问题上比原始TPE能以更少的评估次数找到更好的解。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在Optuna中可用，为组合优化提供了高效的TPE实现。

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够利用绝对奖励数据，同时保持离线学习的简单性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和REBEL）只能从偏好对或相对信号中学习，而在线方法（如PPO和GRPO）复杂且需要在线数据。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO使用分位数奖励，通过回归到KL正则化RL目标的闭式解，避免了相对信号的需求，并支持离线学习。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO，且能减少长度偏差。

Conclusion: QRPO为利用绝对奖励数据提供了一种简单有效的离线方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

Motivation: 解决大模型微调中内存占用高的问题，特别是优化器状态的内存需求。

Method: 提出MoFaSGD，动态更新低秩SVD表示动量，实现高效内存优化。

Result: 在语言模型对齐任务中表现优异，内存减少与性能平衡。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD是一种高效且理论保证的低秩优化方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在处理PINNs中的PDE约束时，难以平衡竞争性损失项，尤其是在刚性或病态系统中。

Method: 提出了一种PDE感知优化器，通过自适应调整参数更新，基于PDE残差梯度的方差，避免二阶优化器的高计算成本。

Result: 在1D Burgers'、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上，PDE感知优化器实现了更平滑的收敛和更低的绝对误差，尤其在梯度变化剧烈的区域。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应方法能有效提升PINNs训练的稳定性，但未来需进一步研究在大规模架构和硬件加速器上的扩展性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial

network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet通过严格约束满足和领域知识集成，为复杂系统的可靠混合建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational

explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously

test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen

about student performance on new items.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习与穿戴设备数据的结合提高了情绪识别的准确性和鲁棒性，为临床和辅助生活场景中的被动情绪监测奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有攻击方法依赖梯度信息，将离散优化问题松弛为连续空间，导致解远离最优且无法适应非可微目标。

Method: 通过进化算法直接解决离散优化问题，支持黑盒模型和任意目标函数，无需可微代理损失。

Result: EvA攻击在实验中平均比现有最佳攻击多降低11%的准确率，并展示了两种新型攻击方式。

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计中的潜在优化空间，为图神经网络的安全性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效帮助设施管理者诊断和缓解能源效率问题。

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM为单细胞RNA-seq数据分析提供了高质量的嵌入和强解释性，有助于揭示生物学机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less

$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与人工智能，旨在利用量子优势提升数据驱动任务。本文综述了QML的潜力、理论基础、关键进展及挑战，并指出其未来发展需解决技术和方法的障碍。


<details>

Motivation: 探索量子机器学习如何解决经典机器学习在复杂数据集处理中的计算瓶颈。

Method: 介绍QML的理论基础（如量子数据编码、学习理论和优化技术），分类QML方法，并评估关键进展（如量子主成分分析）的优缺点。

Result: QML在特定领域（如量子化学和传感）有潜力，但实际应用受限于NISQ设备的噪声、可扩展性和数据编码问题。

Conclusion: QML的未来发展需量子原生算法、改进的错误校正和实际基准测试，以弥合理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Conclusion: 两簇检验是一个独立于传统两样本检验的新问题，提出的方法在理论和实践中均表现出色。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Motivation: 离线预训练的代理在在线微调时因分布偏移导致价值估计不准确，性能不佳，甚至不如随机初始化。

Result: 在TD3和SPOT上实现OPT后，在D4RL多个环境中平均性能提升30%。

Conclusion: OPT有效解决了离线预训练代理在在线微调时的价值估计问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机电报噪声是纳米电子器件中普遍存在的变异性现象，影响器件可靠性和性能，传统分析方法受限。

Method: RTNinja包含LevelsExtractor（贝叶斯推理和模型选择去噪）和SourcesMapper（概率聚类和优化推断源配置）。

Result: 在7000个数据集上，RTNinja实现了高保真信号重建和准确提取源振幅与活动模式。

Conclusion: RTNinja为随机电报噪声分析提供了稳健、可扩展且设备无关的工具，适用于下一代纳米电子学。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

TL;DR: KGRAG-Ex是一个基于知识图谱（KG）的检索增强生成（RAG）系统，通过结构化信息提升事实基础和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RAG在非结构化文本检索中缺乏可解释性的问题。

Method: 利用提示信息提取构建领域特定KG，将查询相关实体和语义路径转化为伪段落，结合扰动解释方法评估KG组件对答案的影响。

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex通过KG显著提升了RAG的事实基础和可解释性，为透明推理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过减少经验损失的方差来增强多层感知机（MLP）的泛化能力。

Method: 引入Rank Set Sampling (RSS)替代传统的Simple Random Sampling (SRS)，以减少损失方差，并开发了RSS-MLP方法。

Result: 理论证明RSS估计的经验损失方差小于SRS，实验在12个基准数据集上验证了RSS-MLP的有效性。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP通过有序采样减少方差，显著提升了MLP的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Motivation: 优化器对减少LLM预训练时间和提升模型性能至关重要，因此比较三种主流优化器的效果。

Method: 使用两种基础架构和单/多轮训练方法，通过Maximal Update Parametrization和小型代理模型调参。

Result: Sophia训练损失最低，Lion训练速度最快，AdamW在下游任务中表现最好。

Conclusion: 不同优化器各有优势，选择需根据具体需求权衡。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Result: 新方法提供了更直接且标准化的评估，并与人类评估结果一致。

Conclusion: 建议社区采用更直接的评估方法，以改进稀疏编码器的可解释性评估。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学反应的本质是电子的重新分配和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突变的，如原子电荷状态的变化或化学键的形成与断裂。

Method: SynBridge采用图到图转换网络架构和离散流桥技术，通过原子和键的离散状态捕捉反应物和产物之间的双向化学转化。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上进行了广泛实验，证明了SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 消融研究和噪声调度分析表明，离散空间上的结构化扩散对反应预测具有显著优势。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile

limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Motivation: SFL在异构环境中存在灾难性遗忘问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架，采用多教师知识蒸馏和差异感知权重分配策略。

Result: SFedKD有效缓解灾难性遗忘，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD为SFL中的灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性和随机环境，并与基于值和演员-评论家算法无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在现实应用中的多功能性和潜力。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算方法和工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: AbbIE是一种新型递归Transformer编码器，通过动态调整计算资源在测试时表现优于标准Transformer，并在零样本学习和语言困惑度上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过递归和动态计算资源调整，探索Transformer性能扩展的新途径，避免依赖大规模参数和数据集。

Method: 采用递归的块式迭代编码器，在潜在空间进行迭代，无需专用数据集或训练协议。

Result: AbbIE在零样本学习任务中提升12%，语言困惑度提升5%，并能动态适应任务复杂度。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新方向，展示了递归和动态计算调整的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在恶意软件分类中因概念漂移导致性能下降，频繁更新依赖高成本标注数据，而半监督学习在此领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ADAPT算法，一种模型无关的半监督伪标签方法，适用于多种机器学习模型（如神经网络和树模型）。

Result: 在五个不同的恶意软件检测数据集上实验表明，ADAPT优于基线模型和竞争基准。

Conclusion: ADAPT为恶意软件检测中概念漂移的适应提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

TL;DR: 通过遥感技术监测印度旁遮普邦的可持续水稻灌溉实践（如DSR和AWD），为政策制定提供数据支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水稻种植消耗大量淡水，可持续灌溉实践可减少用水但缺乏采纳率数据，阻碍政策制定。

Method: 开发遥感框架，结合地面数据和Sentinel-1卫星图像分类系统，区分DSR与传统种植方式。

Result: 分类系统F1得分为78%，能在大规模（300万农田）中准确预测DSR采纳率，与政府数据高度相关。

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了监测可持续水管理实践的工具，支持精准干预和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and
irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing
DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior
knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR
adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with
district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)
with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool
to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and
measure program impacts at scale.

Motivation: 现有标注数据集已用于训练大型视觉语言模型，改进性能困难，无监督图像描述研究不足。

Method: 提出LoGIC，包含说话者和倾听者两个智能体，使用GRPO算法训练，利用预训练模型或轻量组件。

Result: 无监督下BLEU得分46（预训练模型）和31（轻量组件），分别优于基线2分和10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC有效提升无监督图像描述性能，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了不平衡协变量偏移这一复杂异质性，FedAKD旨在平衡预测准确性与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD采用异步知识蒸馏策略，先更新客户端模型，再选择高置信度样本更新全局模型，最后聚合所有客户端模型。

Result: 在FashionMNIST、CIFAR10和真实EHR数据集上，FedAKD显著提升了协作公平性、预测准确性和客户端参与度。

Conclusion: FedAKD通过理论分析和实验验证，有效解决了联邦学习中的协作公平性问题。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

TL;DR: WERSA是一种线性时间复杂度的注意力机制，显著降低计算成本，同时保持性能，适用于长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在长序列上计算成本高的问题，提出一种高效且不牺牲性能的注意力机制。

Method: 结合内容自适应的随机频谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，实现线性复杂度的选择性注意力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著减少训练时间和计算资源，同时提高准确性。

Conclusion: WERSA为长上下文模型提供了更实用、经济的解决方案，推动可持续和可扩展的AI发展。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 传统理论认为模型容量增加会导致过拟合，但实践中很少见。论文探讨了局部过拟合的可能性及其与双下降现象的关系。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段方法：1）通过聚合检查点形成集成模型；2）通过知识蒸馏将集成模型压缩为原始大小的单一模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实验表明，该方法在标签噪声环境下优于原始模型和独立训练的集成模型。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了训练和推理复杂度的双赢，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Conclusion: 研究表明，缺乏领域知识的优化分析可能无效，MAD-OPT为AI在热电厂的安全应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Result: 在模拟和真实实验中，SPLASH在次优演示的奖励学习上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLASH填补了逆强化学习在长时程和对抗性任务中的不足，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Result: 两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确组合对鲁棒性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在RL中设计更鲁棒算法的重要性，尤其是针对超参数敏感性。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测试时遇到数据分布偏移是预测模型部署中的常见挑战，TTA方法虽能暂时适应，但模型最终可能失效，需要离线重训练。因此，需要一种监控机制来检测性能下降的临界点。

Method: 扩展了基于顺序测试和置信序列的现有监控工具，以适应测试时模型更新且无标签数据的情况，实现统计风险监控。

Result: 在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中验证了所提出的TTA监控框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合TTA和风险监控，能够及时检测模型性能下降，为模型维护提供统计支持。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是深度神经网络学习新任务时性能下降的问题，现有方法（如正则化）试图约束重要参数以保留旧知识。本文旨在更有效地识别这些参数。

Method: 提出在训练末期平台（而非整个训练过程）跟踪参数活动，高活动参数表明损失函数中平坦方向，适合适应新任务同时保留旧知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在平衡灾难性遗忘缓解和新任务性能方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 跟踪训练末期平台的参数活动是一种有效减轻灾难性遗忘的方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Motivation: 标准NVAR和RC在混沌系统预测中表现有限，因其固定非线性结构和计算成本高，难以适应高噪声或高维数据。

Method: 结合延迟嵌入线性输入和浅层可学习MLP，通过梯度优化联合训练，避免繁琐的参数搜索。

Result: 在混沌系统中，自适应模型在预测精度和噪声鲁棒性上优于标准NVAR。

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动的非线性特征学习，提高了预测性能并简化了调参过程。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Conclusion: PHQFNO展示了量子-经典混合方法的潜力，为科学机器学习提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

TL;DR: AutoSlim是一个基于机器学习的图简化框架，用于降低符号加速器的复杂性，通过随机森林分类修剪低影响边，显著减少自动机图密度，同时保持语义正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号加速器在基因组学、NLP和网络安全等领域应用广泛，但面临内存使用和路由复杂性的扩展性问题。

Method: AutoSlim利用随机森林分类，基于边得分和结构特征修剪低影响转换，支持加权转换的自动化简化。

Result: 在NAPOLY+上评估，AutoSlim实现了FPGA LUTs减少40%，转换修剪超过30%，并能扩展到比现有基准大一个数量级的图。

Conclusion: AutoSlim通过有效修剪缓解了硬件资源膨胀，证明了硬件互连对成本的重要影响。

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中Q值外推误差是主要问题，线性外推尤其严重。

Method: 采用奖励缩放与层归一化（RS-LN）和不可行动作惩罚（PA）结合，形成PARS算法。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优于现有算法，尤其在AntMaze Ultra任务中显著成功。

Conclusion: PARS算法有效解决了Q值外推问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation
errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation
of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的MoE架构BlockFFN，通过改进路由机制和设计CLS感知训练目标，显著提升了稀疏激活模型的性能和加速友好性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统MoE架构中非可微和不灵活的路由问题，以及稀疏激活模型在低资源条件下的加速不友好性，作者提出了BlockFFN。

Method: 使用结合ReLU激活和RMSNorm的路由器实现可微和灵活的路由；设计CLS感知训练目标以提升TLS和CLS；实现高效的加速内核，结合稀疏激活和推测解码。

Result: BlockFFN在性能上优于其他MoE基线，实现了80%的TLS和70%的8-token CLS，加速内核在终端设备上比密集模型快3.67倍。

Conclusion: BlockFFN通过改进路由和训练目标，显著提升了稀疏激活模型的性能和加速效率，适用于低资源环境。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Conclusion: 强调需要更可靠的LLM评估方法，并发布了改进后的模型和数据集。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RaCRL方法因保守探索易收敛到次优策略，无法有效平衡奖励与安全性。

Method: 提出ORAC方法，通过最大化奖励值函数的上界和最小化风险成本值函数的下界，动态调整成本权重以鼓励探索。

Result: ORAC在Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn等任务中显著改善了奖励与成本的权衡，避免次优策略。

Conclusion: ORAC通过乐观探索和动态调整机制，有效解决了RaCRL中的保守性问题，提升了策略性能。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究因果抽象的有效性，特别是在放宽线性约束后，探讨其对机制可解释性的影响。

Method: 通过理论和实验证明，无限制的对齐映射可以将任何神经网络映射到任何算法。

Result: 实验表明，即使模型无法完成任务，对齐映射仍能达到100%的干预准确率。

Conclusion: 因果抽象在无信息编码假设的情况下是空洞的，未来需研究信息编码与因果抽象的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

Motivation: 解决基于提示的文本转语音模型在控制语音特征时的局限性（如训练时暴露的声学特征有限）和不可控变化问题。

Method: 利用主成分分析确定输出变化的主要潜在特征，并将其作为新标签进行二次微调。

Result: 在两种模型（含和不含情感披露）上评估，结果显示不含情感披露的模型在连续和离散特征上均提高了可控性。

Conclusion: 通过分析不可控变化并引入潜在特征标签，有效提升了模型的可控性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化任务，但需改进以提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,

finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

Result: LLMs展现出类似‘理解’的内部结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应转向研究LLMs的独特工作机制，而非争论其是否‘理解’。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to

Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit

Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation

Motivation: LLMs的开放性带来了安全风险，尤其是嵌入空间中毒攻击，但现有研究对LLM安全对齐的动态理解不足。

Result: 在五个开源LLMs上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了当前对齐策略的漏洞，强调需要嵌入感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过外部和内部实验全面研究了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像描述任务中的应用，探讨了演示配置策略和模型行为特征，并提出了新的度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有ICL能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但对多模态ICL的演示配置研究尚不充分。此外，ICEs的可控性为分析LMMs的推理特性提供了高效且经济的手段。

Method: 外部实验从三个维度（shot数量、图像检索、标题分配）探索演示配置策略，并系统评估；内部实验分析LMMs的注意力特征，提出基于注意力的度量方法，并进行辅助实验探索模型加速和压缩的可行性。

Result: 研究发现ICEs配置策略显著影响模型性能，并揭示了LMMs的典型注意力模式。此外，预训练数据特征解释了不同LMMs的性能差异。

Conclusion: 通过外部和内部分析的双重视角，本文为理解多模态ICL提供了新见解，提出的方法和度量可广泛应用于其他研究领域。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大多数商业大语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，主要受训练数据、人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）、学术伦理讨论中的自由主义框架及安全微调实践影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs政治倾向的成因及其影响，区分政治“偏见”与合法认知差异。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和当前政治争议指数，分析七种主流LLMs的政治倾向。

Result: 多数模型优先考虑自由主义价值观（如关怀与公平），微调通常增强自由主义倾向。

Conclusion: LLMs的自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映无个人利益的道德立场，为集体推理提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提高了候选人通过最终面试的概率（54% vs. 34%），并增加了5.9个百分点的就业机会差异。AI倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响，填补实证研究的空白。

Method: 将37,000名申请者随机分配到传统招聘流程或AI辅助流程，比较最终面试通过率和后续就业情况。

Result: AI流程的候选人通过率更高（20个百分点差异），且就业机会增加5.9个百分点。AI倾向于选择年轻、经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI在招聘中能提高效率，但需注意其选择偏好可能带来的潜在影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

TL;DR: 研究发现，2022至2025年间，生成式AI模型（如LLM和VLM）在医疗图像和临床问题回答中，免责声明的使用率显著下降，从2022年的26.3%降至2025年的0.97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在医疗应用中免责声明的使用情况，以确保用户意识到AI输出未经专业审核。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸部X光片、500份皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛选模型输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%降至2025年的0.97%，2023年的19.6%降至2025年的1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力的提升，免责声明需根据临床背景调整，以确保安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了小型语言模型（SLMs）在心理健康理解任务中的表现，发现其性能接近大型语言模型（LLMs），尤其是在二分类任务中，且通过少量样本学习（few-shot）能显著提升SLMs的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨SLMs作为隐私保护替代方案在敏感应用（如心理健康分析）中的实际能力，并与LLMs进行对比。

Method: 采用零样本和少量样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康理解任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数相差2%），但在多分类任务中性能下降显著。少量样本学习对SLMs提升明显（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，尤其是作为隐私保护工具，适合快速适应和扩展的筛查应用。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Motivation: 解决LLMs因缺乏上下文信息而导致的低质量回答或幻觉问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过访问外部API获取额外信息，并提供计算能力（如计算器、日历）。

Result: 在MMLU数据集上测试，数学推理准确率83%，科学推理88%，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLMs的复杂计算生态系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实用性有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型缺乏临床相关性、多视图支持不足以及评估指标与临床需求不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用、挑战和差距，以促进其更好地融入医疗实践。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献回顾和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和临床需求。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图或多分辨率成像，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生调查显示仅29.8%认为MedVQA高度有用，主要关注点包括缺乏患者历史和领域知识。

Conclusion: 尽管MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、患者背景缺失和评估方法不匹配等问题，才能有效融入临床工作。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Conclusion: CRISP验证了微调小模型在计划生成任务上的有效性，并展示了其泛化能力，为复杂推理任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Conclusion: AblationBench为评估语言模型代理在消融实验规划中的能力提供了基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指出思维链提示的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul提出了一种动态选择KV缓存压缩策略的系统，显著提升了多轮对话中LLM的恢复效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法固定压缩策略，忽略了对话间注意力模式的动态变化，导致准确性下降。

Method: Krul动态选择压缩策略，引入预选策略选择器、注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器。

Result: 实验显示Krul在TTFT和KV缓存存储上分别减少了1.5x-2.68x和1.33x-2.35x。

Conclusion: Krul在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了效率和存储性能。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

Motivation: 解决自然语言到SPARQL查询的转换问题，避免对模型进行微调，提高泛化能力。

Method: 利用大语言模型探索知识图谱，通过策略性执行SPARQL查询搜索相关IRIs和字面量。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零样本状态下的最优结果，在Freebase上接近少样本方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种知识图谱和基准测试中表现优异，展示了零样本设置的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定token重要性，显著减少内存负担，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中KV缓存内存占用高的问题，提升吞吐量并降低服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行token重要性评估，实现KV缓存的压缩，并提出上下文校准压缩方法。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor仅保留一半token即可达到竞争方法性能，KV内存负担减少63%。

Conclusion: Compactor是一种高效、通用的KV缓存压缩方法，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式大语言模型（LLMs）常产生不真实的回答，准确预测其真实性在高风险场景中至关重要。

Method: TruthTorchLM提供多样化的真实性预测方法，涵盖不同计算成本、访问级别和监督类型，兼容HuggingFace和LiteLLM。

Result: 在TriviaQA、GSM8K和FactScore-Bio数据集上评估了代表性方法。

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM为LLM输出真实性预测提供了全面且可扩展的工具，加速相关研究。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，微调后的LLMs表现出意外的跨分布泛化能力（OOCR），原因是LoRA微调引入了一个恒定的导向向量，使模型能够泛化到相关概念任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调后为何能表现出超出上下文的推理能力（OOCR），以理解其泛化机制。

Method: 通过LoRA微调分析OOCR现象，发现其本质是添加了一个恒定的导向向量，并通过实验验证这一机制。

Result: 研究发现导向向量能显著提升任务性能，并在相关领域实现泛化，甚至适用于条件行为任务（如模型后门）。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了微调过程中导向向量的作用，为LLMs的OOCR能力提供了机制解释，对其安全可靠部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为代理学生在智能辅导系统（ITSs）和测试题目开发中的表现，发现未经指导的强模型普遍优于真实学生，而弱模型或领域不匹配的模型可能偶然对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs是否能准确模拟真实学生的行为和特征，为智能辅导系统和测试开发提供可靠代理。

Method: 收集489项NAEP数据，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力对标。

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生，弱模型偶然对齐；提示调整性能但效果因模型和提示而异。

Conclusion: 需新训练和评估策略，提供选择可行代理的指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Result: F1分数为0.86，女性帖子更情感化，某些疾病和药物反应存在性别差异。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中起重要作用，未来研究应更多关注性别因素。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中过度思考的问题，同时提升模型的效率和可控性。

Method: 1. 构建双机制数据集；2. 使用多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏；3. 冷启动初始化策略；4. 提出Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中表现优异，token使用减少约30%，并在实际部署中提升开发效率。

Conclusion: KAT展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性和实用性，未来计划扩展至200B MoE模型。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在OCR任务中表现优异，但在DIMT任务中因跨模态和跨语言挑战而表现不佳，且传统微调方法会导致OCR能力遗忘。

Method: 引入SSR范式，模型在生成翻译文本前先生成OCR文本，利用其OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升MLLMs在OCR和DIMT任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR是一种有效的微调方法，能同时保持和提升MLLMs的多任务能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，帮助商家生成高质量的消息模板和写作指导，提升CRM效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商家在私人领域渠道（如即时通讯和电子邮件）中缺乏撰写有说服力内容的专业知识和工具，导致CRM效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式运作：基于群组的学习、检索与适应、以及基于规则的备用方案。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原始模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，有效提升CRM消息的生成质量和效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程已能生成有竞争力的商业创意，但在某些领域需更深入的专业知识。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Motivation: 研究对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练文本重排器中的实际效果差异，为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 通过训练不同规模和架构的重排器，对比两种方法在同一数据上的表现，并使用强对比学习模型作为知识蒸馏的教师。

Result: 知识蒸馏在大模型教师时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型容量相同时无优势。

Conclusion: 推荐在有大模型教师时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Motivation: 探索如何充分发挥LLMs和RLLMs在金融领域的性能。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法的效果。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链思维能力，传统方法提升有限；多语言对齐方法对RLLMs效果不明显。

Conclusion: 研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Motivation: 现有指标在英语中与人工评估相关，但在其他语言中的适用性未知，需系统评估。

Method: 设计大规模评估套件，覆盖八种语言（四种类型学家族），分析指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在融合语言中与人工评估相关性较低，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合语言中有限，应更多投资于神经指标训练。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and

*Zilu Dong,Xiangqing Shen,Zinong Yang,Rui Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit结合知识图谱逻辑规则与LLM推理能力，系统性更新知识，提升逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识编辑方法在传播关联事实时难以保持逻辑一致性。

Method: 利用知识图谱提取逻辑规则，与LLM内部逻辑对齐，动态生成和编辑逻辑关联知识簇。

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化能力提升30%以上，同时保持编辑可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现了逻辑一致性的新最优性能。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识，加入共识检测智能体可提升辩论效率和决策质量。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统在模拟群体决策过程中具有潜力，可支持跨领域专家研讨会的决策支持。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Method: 建立包含6个主要和15个次要类别的错误归因框架，创建AttriData数据集，并基于此微调MisAttributionLLM模型。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，模型能同时生成评分、错误归因和反馈。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型为LLM错误分析提供了系统化工具，填补了现有评估模型的不足。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

*Marina Luketina,Andrea Benkel,Christoph G. Schuetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型（LLM）在奥地利和欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，发现LLM在配置适当时可有效支持税务专业人员，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务咨询中客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLM有望自动化决策并减轻专业人员负担，但其幻觉倾向带来挑战。

Method: 通过微调和检索增强生成（RAG）方法，在教科书案例和实际案例中测试LLM性能。

Result: LLM可自动化常规任务并提供初步分析，但当前原型无法完全自动化，需进一步改进。

Conclusion: LLM在税务领域有潜力，但需解决隐性客户知识和上下文文档处理问题。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Abstract: The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech
recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high
practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025
Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM),
achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究为改进教育类文章连贯性的自动评分提供了一种潜在的有效方法。

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Result: clembench已持续开发并优化，便于广泛使用和扩展。

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are
available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLM）与潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）结合的两种方式：初始化和后校正。实验表明，LLM引导的初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且性能最差；而LLM后校正在一致性评估中提升了5.86%。

Motivation: 研究LLM如何增强LDA模型的性能，特别是在初始化和后校正阶段，以验证LLM是否总是优于传统文本挖掘方法。

Method: 通过LLM引导的主题聚类初始化Gibbs采样算法，并在后校正阶段利用LLM优化结果。

Result: LLM初始化对LDA早期迭代有改进，但对收敛无影响且性能最差；LLM后校正在一致性评估中提升了5.86%。

Conclusion: LLM在LDA的后校正阶段表现优异，但初始化效果不佳，挑战了LLM总是优于传统方法的观点。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学问题上表现出色，为机器验证定理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are

Method: 设计了知识图谱引导注意力模块（KGA），包含外向聚合（动态融合外部知识）和内向聚合（过滤任务无关信号）的双路径机制。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能。

Conclusion: KGA框架实现了无需参数更新的实时知识融合，显著提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: MM-Coder是一个多语言多模态软件开发者，通过结合视觉设计输入（如UML图和流程图）与文本指令，提升代码生成的准确性和架构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽略了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如流程图和UML图），导致代码生成与实际需求脱节。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder模型，结合视觉工作流（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了多模态指令调优数据集MMc-Instruct。同时提出新评测基准MMEval。

Result: 评估显示，模型在精确捕捉视觉信息、遵循指令和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder通过多模态输入有望革新工业编程，使LLMs能更好地理解和实现复杂需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Method: 利用GPT-4生成的推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接干预键值缓存。

Result: 实验表明，缓存引导改善了推理结构和任务性能，优于需要持续干预的现有方法。

Conclusion: 缓存引导在超参数稳定性、推理效率和集成便捷性上具有优势，是更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对不足，其可靠性和性能评估缺乏系统性，因此需要建立全面的评估框架。

Method: 创建了一个新数据集，利用GPT-4生成文本描述作为基准，通过文本到图像模型生成图像，再通过GPT-4评估生成图像与描述的差异。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，用于改进LoRA微调的收敛性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能提升。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束条件，提出无需训练的闭式权重估计方法，并支持可变秩。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了更快的收敛和更高的性能，并通过分析验证了其设计选择的合理性。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效的图像分类方法，尤其适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯配准的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合配准模块，实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐和精确的相机姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决优化型3DGS方法在稀疏视图下因先验知识不足而表现不佳，以及前馈高斯方法因输入格式限制难以扩展更多视图的问题。

Method: 采用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输MW₂距离作为对齐度量，并设计联合配准模块整合MW₂距离、光度一致性和深度几何。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐、精确的相机姿态估计和高质量的新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合配准模块，有效解决了稀疏视图下的3D重建问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或动态主体完全可见，导致在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强视频序列的一致性。

Result: 在挑战性单目视频上验证，显示处理遮挡和时间稳定性优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架无需模板，适应性强，显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the

*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HNOSeg-XS是一种基于Hartley变换和可学习偏微分方程的医学图像分割架构，解决了CNN和Transformer在长距离空间相关性和计算效率上的不足，具有分辨率鲁棒性、高效性和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中因计算成本和内存占用导致的输入尺寸限制问题，以及离散训练带来的次优结果。

Method: 通过傅里叶神经算子建模可学习偏微分方程，并用Hartley变换替代傅里叶变换，在频域中重新定义问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB，优于CNN和Transformer模型。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割解决方案，适用于高分辨率图像。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

Result: 在生物医学影像数据中，SurfDist表现优于StarDist-3D，实例参数化更紧凑。

Conclusion: SurfDist展示了可解释的实例表面模型与实例成员关系学习的有效性。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种便携式生物力学实验室（PBL），通过智能手机应用和算法测量生物力学数据，验证了其在临床中的可靠性和敏感性。


<details>

Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用。PBL旨在填补这一空白，提供可访问且有效的工具。

Method: 开发了PBL系统，包括智能手机应用和算法，用于收集和分析生物力学数据，并在多种临床环境中验证其性能。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标可靠且敏感，能够反映临床差异，如与mJOA评分的相关性。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种可扩展、低负担的生物力学测量工具，有望广泛应用于运动障碍监测。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CR-Net的新型SAR目标检测方法，结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了跨分辨率检测中的领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR分辨率的提升导致散射特性差异增大，影响目标检测模型的泛化能力，现有领域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net整合了结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA），通过结构相关性和可靠语义对齐提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中表现优异，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和提升判别能力，显著提升了跨分辨率适应性能。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Motivation: 现有3D方法在音频驱动说话头生成中存在运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透等渲染伪影，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出三步框架：视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建；采用多粒度运动解耦策略和交替优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，M2DAO-Talker在生成质量和视频真实感上优于TalkingGaussian，PSNR提升2.43 dB，用户评价真实感提升0.64，推理速度达150 FPS。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过改进的运动建模和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的视觉效果和效率。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Conclusion: 该方法为颅面重建提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得显著进展，但其大模型和缺乏透明度限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现有针对性的压缩，保持临床意义表征。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率和低精度损失。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量级、可解释模型的部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Motivation: 解决传统生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索的问题，以提高模型的解释性和组合性。

Method: 利用基于扩散的能量函数，支持后验干预（如概念组合和否定），并通过显式概念传递所有信息。

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上实验表明，CoCo-Bot在概念级可控性和可解释性上表现优异，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，显著提升了生成模型的解释性和组合性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Result: 在四种癌症类型的基准测试中表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG在实验中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能，确保了隐写图像的秘密可恢复性和不可感知性。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性攻击，显著提升了隐写术的隐蔽性和性能。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中ICL技术对查询图像与上下文图像-掩码对对齐敏感的问题，特别是在标注数据稀缺的临床场景中。

Method: 采用循环管道，首先生成分割掩码，然后交换查询和上下文对角色以验证预测，并通过查询特定提示优化对齐。

Result: 在七个医学图像分割数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法，提升了ICL分割的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CCV是一种有效的解决方案，能够增强基于ICL的医学图像分割，适用于通用医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

Result: 在图像质量和GEFU任务（分类、检测、语义分割）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU范式显著提升了低光视觉任务的泛化性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.

such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在保持主题一致时牺牲姿势多样性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：Identity Transport（IT）和Identity Refinement（IR），分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度上表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调的问题，提出统一的2D位移估计框架以实现多任务集成。

Method: 利用跨领域数据集预训练模型，结合通用特征提取器和特征转换管道，实现零样本跨视图匹配。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在异常场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了通用模型在多任务和异常场景中的潜力，为鲁棒匹配提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能降低检索性能。SHC通过语义哈希中心改进这一问题。

Method: 1. 使用分类网络识别类间语义相似性；2. 提出优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3. 训练深度哈希网络生成二进制哈希码。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升了7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过语义哈希中心显著提升了检索性能，验证了语义关系在哈希码生成中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种新的多模态条件提示学习方法，通过生成语义和视觉条件提示，并结合多提示融合机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型在未见类别上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在未见类别的泛化能力和跨模态对齐方面存在不足，限制了模型性能。

Method: MuGCP利用多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示（SCP），并通过注意力互导模块（AMG）生成视觉条件提示（VCP），最后通过多提示融合机制（MPF）整合不同提示。

Result: MuGCP在14个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过条件提示生成和多模态对齐优化，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

Motivation: 人类能自然识别并补全遮挡物体，但机器人难以实现类似能力。现有方法将场景视为整体，无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 提出空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视图中的栅格化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型完成实例重建。

Conclusion: InstaScene通过创新方法解决了复杂场景中实例分解和完整重建的挑战，为机器人3D感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU是一种无需训练的框架，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍实际应用。现有方法主要在时间维度加速，空间维度仍有优化空间。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，结合噪声时间步重调度稳定生成。

Result: RALU在FLUX上实现7.0倍加速，Stable Diffusion 3上3.0倍加速，且图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU在空间维度显著加速扩散模型推理，且与现有时间加速方法互补，可进一步降低延迟而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景中实现了更真实、一致的3D修复效果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习在3D重建中展现出巨大潜力，但未来仍需解决模型精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等挑战。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Motivation: 现有文档识别方法忽视文档类型的内在结构，导致对复杂或低频文档类型的识别效果不佳。

Result: 实验证明该方法在复杂文档类型（如乐谱、工程图）中有效，并首次实现了工程图的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文档基础模型的设计提供了统一框架，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice
Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET
2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a
versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research
and practical clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为D2Dewarp的双维度文档去扭曲模型，通过感知水平和垂直方向的变形趋势，结合有效的融合模块，显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅关注水平维度的文本行，忽略了垂直方向的变形趋势，限制了去扭曲的效果。

Method: 提出了D2Dewarp模型，结合水平和垂直维度的特征，设计了一个基于X和Y坐标的融合模块，并构建了一个新的大规模扭曲训练数据集。

Result: 在公开的中英文基准测试中，定量和定性结果均显示该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: D2Dewarp通过双维度特征融合和自动标注的数据集，显著提升了文档去扭曲的性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

Conclusion: 模型和数据集将公开，推动多目标跟踪研究。

Abstract: This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people
tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying
on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that
aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless
information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling,
the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new
large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene
reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with
flexibility across diverse conditions. Both the dataset and approach will be
publicly released to advance research in multi-people tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR通过强化知识蒸馏和遮挡感知特征净化，解决了遮挡行人重识别中的多样遮挡和特征污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理训练中未见的多样遮挡场景，且易受整体图像特征污染的影响。

Method: 采用师生蒸馏架构，设计遮挡感知ViT和特征净化模块，通过强化学习识别并替换低质量补丁。

Result: OGFR能有效学习鲁棒特征表示，不受遮挡干扰。

Conclusion: OGFR在遮挡行人重识别中表现出色，解决了多样遮挡和特征污染问题。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RadiomicsRetrieval的3D医学图像检索框架，结合手工放射组学特征和深度学习嵌入，支持灵活查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需要完全标注的查询，限制了临床灵活性。

Method: 使用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性嵌入，并通过对比学习与放射组学特征对齐，结合解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺CT和脑MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征显著提升检索特异性，APE支持基于位置的搜索。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需最小用户提示（如单点），支持灵活查询，适用于诊断、治疗计划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则处理干扰、遮挡和对象运动，本文探索强化学习在内存控制中的潜力。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的内存更新。

Result: 在单视频过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是优化内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: DA-KPN是一种新的图像翻译方法，通过轻量级翻译函数和语义匹配保证，解决了GAN方法在语义分割中的噪声标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实世界数据标注困难，语义分割依赖合成数据训练，但现有GAN方法无法保证语义匹配，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DA-KPN，通过估计像素级输入变换参数，结合多尺度判别器确保翻译的真实性。

Result: DA-KPN在语义分割的合成到真实基准测试中优于GAN方法，并在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN通过语义匹配保证和轻量级设计，显著提升了低数据环境下的语义分割性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将体素作为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，影响了补全结果的精细度。

Method: 提出DISC双流范式，用区分性类别查询替代体素查询，并设计专用解码模块以促进类别级信息流。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，mIoU分别为17.35和20.55。

Conclusion: DISC显著提升了实例类别的性能，仅用单帧输入即超越多帧SOTA方法。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理随时间演变的分布偏移（如光照或季节变化）时表现不佳，存在记忆限制、置信度不可靠和表征不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出BayesTTA框架，通过增量估计类条件高斯混合分布、自适应选择协方差结构和校准推理，动态对齐视觉表征。

Result: 在四个时间演变的基准数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演变的分布偏移问题，提升了模型的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,

automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal

containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征结合时，动态物体运动导致性能提升有限，需解决时序特征对齐问题。

Method: 采用循环结构结合BEV特征，使用MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，引入时序一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能超越当前最优方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时序特征对齐和循环结构，显著提升了相机3D感知性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能高效构建高质量真实图像数据集，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI的高成本和稀缺性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI具有更高的分辨率和对比度，但成本高且稀缺，且存在易感性伪影等问题。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以使其更广泛应用于临床。

Method: 使用141例患者（1.5T和3T T1W MRI）的数据集，训练并验证7T-Restormer模型，并与ResViT和ResShift模型进行比较。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现出色，PSNR和SSIM优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合训练策略优于单一训练策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效合成7T质量的图像，为临床工作流程提供了更便捷的7T MRI替代方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: ByDeWay是一个无需训练的框架，通过分层深度提示（LDP）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能，增强空间推理和基础能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中表现不足，ByDeWay旨在通过无需修改模型参数的方法解决这些问题。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将这些深度感知描述附加到图像-问题提示中。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: ByDeWay证明了深度感知提示在零训练设置中的有效性，是一种轻量级、模块化的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on

TL;DR: MoSAiC是一个统一框架，通过联合优化多模态卫星影像的对比学习，解决了地球系统观测中的多标签和语义精确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中，多模态卫星影像的高类间相似性和场景复杂性给表示学习带来挑战，现有对比学习方法缺乏多标签对齐机制。

Method: 提出MoSAiC框架，结合了多标签监督对比损失，优化了多模态卫星影像的对比学习。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在低标签和高类重叠场景中表现优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC在多模态卫星影像中实现了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表示学习。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于关键点跟踪的无训练分割方法，用于MRI肌肉分割，减少计算成本并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法计算成本高、泛化能力有限且可解释性差，需要改进。

Method: 结合关键点选择和Lucas-Kanade光流，实现无训练分割。

Result: DSC为0.6-0.7，与CNN方法相当，但计算需求更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为肌肉分割提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的嵌入式字幕评估指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕评估方法效率不足，需要一种更高效的指标。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP，并设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在保持多模态对齐能力的同时减少了计算资源和时间。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为评估指标高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Motivation: 现有确定性注意力MIL方法忽略了实例相关性的不确定性，SGPMIL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SGPMIL利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力得分的后验分布，并引入特征缩放以提升效率和性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现出色。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持袋级性能，还显著提升不确定性下的实例级预测质量。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user

response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集，支持进一步分析和应用。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉任务中常面临训练数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 采用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，利用其多尺度纹理表征能力和低相关性特点。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV方法（AUC=0.87）优于深度学习（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79）。

Conclusion: STV特征集成方法在数据不足的场景下表现优异，尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测具有显著指示作用。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Result: 构建MM-5B数据集，HieraRS在语义一致性和分类准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: HieraRS提升了遥感影像层次分类的灵活性和泛化能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，显著降低通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

TL;DR: Birkhoff是一种针对Segment Anything Model（SAM）及其变体的无数据压缩算法，具有通用性、部署敏捷性、模型忠实性和紧凑性。其核心是Hyper-Compression算法和HyperLinear算子，实验表明在压缩比、性能和推理速度上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在高质量零样本分割中的出色表现，其压缩需求日益迫切，需要一种高效且通用的压缩方法。

Method: 提出Birkhoff算法，包括Hyper-Compression（将高维参数向量转为低维标量）和HyperLinear（融合解压缩与矩阵乘法以加速推理）。

Result: 在18个SAM模型上的实验显示，Birkhoff在压缩比（如5.17x）、性能损失（<1%）和压缩时间（<60秒）上表现优异。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的SAM压缩方法，适用于多种场景，且无需微调数据。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知设计显著提升了3D生成的细节、可控性和组合能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFT是一种高效且灵活的神经渲染方法，能够在保持高质量渲染的同时显著减少数据量，适用于不同计算需求的应用场景。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code
