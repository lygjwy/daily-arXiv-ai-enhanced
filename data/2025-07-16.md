### [1] [SAMEP: A Secure Protocol for Persistent Context Sharing Across AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10562)
*Hari Masoor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMEP是一种新型框架，解决了AI代理在记忆共享中的持久性、安全性和语义搜索问题，显著提升了协作效率和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理架构存在记忆短暂性问题，限制了跨会话和代理边界的协作与知识共享。

Method: SAMEP采用分布式记忆存储库，结合向量语义搜索、加密访问控制（AES-256-GCM）和标准化API。

Result: 实验显示，SAMEP减少了73%的冗余计算，提升了89%的上下文相关性，并完全符合监管要求。

Conclusion: SAMEP为持久、协作的AI代理生态系统提供了安全、隐私保障的新范式。

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations,
preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and
agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a
novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable
memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical
challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2)
secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3)
efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a
distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic
access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing
agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness
across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare
AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental
results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in
context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements
including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent,
collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy
guarantees.

### [2] [AI Mother Tongue: Self-Emergent Communication in MARL via Endogenous Symbol Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10566)
*Hung Ming Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过AIM框架证明，当代理拥有内生符号系统时，无需外部归纳偏置即可实现有效的符号通信，并提出了三个理论见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨传统方法中的人工归纳偏置是否过度设计，以及代理是否可以通过内生符号系统实现自然通信。

Method: 使用基于VQ-VAE的AIM框架，分析代理的神经表征和语义压缩行为。

Result: 代理的内生符号系统实现了自发的语义压缩和纳什均衡驱动的语义收敛，通信效果优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AIM框架为符号主义和连接主义的结合提供了新途径，未来将探索HQ-VAE和RL预训练的潜力。

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development
of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration
Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' .
Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate
communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such
artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments
with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized
Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an
endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit
spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic
convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external
inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that
the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and
resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM
demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis
toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a
significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical
insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First
Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research
will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders
(HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the
potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This
discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

### [3] [Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Agentic AI Visual Classification System with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10571)
*Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis,Ranjan Sapkota,Manoj Karkee,Nikolaos D. Tselikas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化的多智能体AI视觉分类框架，结合了通用多模态智能体、非视觉推理协调器和RAG模块，用于苹果叶病诊断，显著提升了零样本场景下的准确率和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体AI在零样本场景下的信任问题，特别是在视觉和语言理解结合的领域。

Method: 引入模块化框架，结合多模态智能体、协调器和RAG模块，通过置信度校准和图像检索优化信任和性能。

Result: 零样本场景下准确率提升77.94%，总体达到85.63%，GPT-4o表现更优校准，Qwen-2.5-VL存在过度自信问题。

Conclusion: 该框架分离感知与元推理，可扩展至其他信任关键领域，所有资源开源以支持透明性和社区基准测试。

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent
architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing
challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot
settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual
classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a
non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three
configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)
fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated
orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.
Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator
modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy
improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,
achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL
displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with
visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via
iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision
agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable
multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other
trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components
including the complete software source code are openly released to support
reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:

### [4] [Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10624)
*Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs表面流畅但符号推理、算术准确性和逻辑一致性任务失败，原因是理解与能力之间的鸿沟，称为“计算分裂脑综合征”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在任务失败中的结构性原因，理解其能力边界。

Method: 通过控制实验和架构分析，研究LLMs在原则表达与应用上的不一致性。

Result: 发现LLMs缺乏组合推理的架构支持，行为脆弱，指令与执行路径几何分离。

Conclusion: 未来模型需引入元认知控制和结构化执行，当前LLMs能力有限，解释性研究需谨慎。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet
systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy,
and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such
failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and
\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,
we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably
applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational
execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain
syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and
functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from
mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model
behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs
function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural
scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the
boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with
metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.
This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may
reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal
computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction
and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and
mechanistic analysis.

### [5] [Enhancing the Capabilities of Large Language Models for API calls through Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10630)
*Ye Yang,Xue Xiao,Ping Yin,Taotao Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG2data结合知识图谱、LLMs和工具使用技术，提升气象领域数据查询性能，优于RAG2data和chat2data。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在知识密集型领域（如气象学）中通过API调用有效使用工具的潜力。

Method: 集成知识图谱、LLMs、ReAct代理和工具使用技术，通过虚拟API评估API调用准确性。

Result: KG2data在名称识别失败（1.43%）、幻觉失败（0%）和调用正确性（88.57%）上表现优异。

Conclusion: KG2data为高知识需求领域提供了智能问答和数据分析的新方案。

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for
data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API
calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology.
This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs,
ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition
and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we
evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure,
hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior
performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and
chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based
systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which
hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a
knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval,
complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship
resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost
of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain
knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for
intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains
with high knowledge demands.

### [6] [From Semantic Web and MAS to Agentic AI: A Unified Narrative of the Web of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10644)
*Tatiana Petrova,Aleksandr Puzikov,Boris Bliznukov,Radu State*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了Web of Agents（WoA）的演化历程，提出了一个四轴分类法，揭示了智能体架构的演变趋势，并指出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究WoA领域的碎片化问题，整合多智能体系统（MAS）和语义Web的历史，以全面理解现代系统的演化路径。

Method: 引入四轴分类法（语义基础、通信范式、智能中心、发现机制），系统比较不同世代的智能体架构。

Result: 揭示了智能中心从外部数据或平台转移到智能体核心模型的范式转变，为现代Agentic AI奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于去中心化身份、经济模型、安全与治理等社会技术挑战，以构建稳健开放的WoA生态系统。

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,
document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'
behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become
more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across
different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered
frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the
Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation
obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic
understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive
evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and
the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations
of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To
systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic
foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery
mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing
agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent
where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift
in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic
Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model
(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable
and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new
protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,
trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies
in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda
focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance
for the emerging WoA.

### [7] [Parsing Musical Structure to Enable Meaningful Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10740)
*Maziar Kanani,Sean O Leary,James McDermott*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于规则的变调音乐生成方法，通过解析原始曲调生成语法结构，并对其进行随机变异以生成新曲调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过变异语法结构而非直接修改曲调来生成新音乐，探索曲调在多轮变异中的变化规律。

Method: 使用Sequitur算法解析曲调生成语法结构（PA），随机应用19种变异类型（如添加、删除、交换等），再扩展语法生成新曲调。

Result: 通过编辑距离、结构复杂度和曲调长度分析变异效果，评估每种变异类型的影响，并检查生成曲调的音乐性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成与原始曲调相关的新曲调，但仅关注音高序列生成，未涉及其他音乐元素。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by
varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [
1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur
algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out
mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially
19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of
the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the
mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.
Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.
The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original
tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple
mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are
used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the
size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review
the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only
focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish
traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each
tune's pitch values.

TL;DR: AI的发展短期内可能增加能源消耗和CO2排放，但长期来看有望通过优化流程显著减少碳足迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI对数据中心的能源消耗和温室气体排放的影响，以及AI在能源生产、供应和消费中的潜力。

Method: 分析近短期（至2030年）和长期（2035年及以后）的能源消耗情景及CO2排放影响。

Result: 短期内AI需求增长可能导致CO2排放增加，但长期AI的优化能力有望减少碳足迹。

Conclusion: AI虽初期对环境有负面影响，但长期可能成为气候缓解的重要工具。

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources,
and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked
significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with
the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and
AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy
consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering
both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and
beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net
positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,
we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive
workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and
consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely
strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and
therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of
big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and
complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and
applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more
promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its
ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from
energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon
footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial
emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where
traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some
initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support
climate mitigation efforts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文通过深度学习模型检测IoT恶意攻击，评估了多种模型（如GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN等）的性能，BERT表现最佳，准确率达99.94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT系统流量模式具有时序性和多样性，为模型学习提供了丰富的数据，需高效检测恶意攻击。

Method: 采用GraphSAGE、BERT、TCN、Multi-Head Attention、BI-LSTM等模型，分析其性能。

Result: BERT表现最优（准确率99.94%），Multi-Head Attention提供可解释结果但耗时，GraphSAGE训练最快但性能最低。

Conclusion: BERT在捕获时序依赖方面表现卓越，适合IoT恶意攻击检测；其他模型各有优劣，需根据需求选择。

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning
models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and
graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models
particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head
Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM)
Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models
demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature
significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT
system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of
temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that
BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate
alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which
demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The
Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection
capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head
Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The
GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training
time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the
other models

TL;DR: 论文提出将AI辅助检测视为分类任务，通过适当预处理数据，常见模型能有效分类抽象任务数据。作者构建了四种图像表达方式和一种时间序列表达方式，验证了时空编码对AI辅助检测的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在文本生成、医疗诊断等复杂任务中的普及，检测AI辅助变得重要，但抽象任务数据对机器学习不友好，需要有效方法。

Method: 构建四种神经网络友好的图像表达方式和一种时间序列表达方式，结合经典深度学习架构和并行CNN-RNN架构进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，适当预处理的数据能被有效分类，时空编码显著提升检测性能。

Conclusion: 编码时空信息对检测抽象任务中的AI辅助至关重要，提出的方法具有通用性。

Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important
as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical
diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans,
especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel
at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process
large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting
help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in
this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes,
such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data
that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can
effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so,
we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along
with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the
exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other
abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three
classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN
architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing
performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial
quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

TL;DR: SigmaScheduling动态调整决策点时间，提高移动健康干预的及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定间隔的决策点调度对习惯性行为干预效果不佳，尤其是对作息不规律的用户。

Method: 提出SigmaScheduling方法，根据行为时间预测的不确定性动态调整决策点。

Result: 在68名参与者的试验中，SigmaScheduling在70%以上的情况下确保决策点早于目标行为。

Conclusion: SigmaScheduling能提升精准移动健康干预的效果，适用于时间敏感的习惯性行为。

Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health
(mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points,"
intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey
data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting
habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on
delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.
Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)
before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same
for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly
for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after
the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.
In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule
decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior
timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to
the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling
schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely
intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68
participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily
toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points
preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to
intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can
advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive,
habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

Motivation: 评估LLM在复制专家驱动的社交媒体数据主题分析中的可行性，以解决其缺乏领域专业知识的挑战。

Method: 使用两个Reddit数据集，将任务建模为一系列二元分类，采用零样本、单样本和少量样本提示策略，并测量性能指标。

Result: GPT-4o在少量样本提示下表现最佳（准确率90.9%，F1分数0.71），高流行主题的分布与专家分类接近。

Conclusion: 少量样本LLM方法可自动化主题分析，为定性研究提供可扩展的补充。

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic
analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We
evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic
analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting
Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and
validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five
LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary
classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing
zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,
GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:
0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely
mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:
16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based
approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for
qualitative research. Keywords: thematic analysis, large language models,

TL;DR: AF-XRAY是一个开源工具包，用于探索、分析和可视化法律推理中的抽象论证框架（AFs），帮助非专家识别模糊性来源并解释论证接受性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律推理中的论证框架（AFs）存在模糊性和解释难题，非专家难以理解。AF-XRAY旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AF-XRAY提供分层可视化、攻击边分类、替代解决方案覆盖和关键攻击集识别功能。

Result: 通过系统生成关键攻击集，AF-XRAY将模糊场景转化为明确的解决方案，支持法律推理中的目的论分析。

Conclusion: AF-XRAY能有效揭示模糊性根源，帮助用户探索不同假设下的结论，适用于实际法律案例。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning,
but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains
challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for
exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY
introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length
revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack
edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay
visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded
semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension
resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack
sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling
users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative
resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by
Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by
revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

TL;DR: NavComposer是一个自动生成高质量导航指令的框架，结合NavInstrCritic进行无标注评估，提升语言导航研究的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家提供的导航指令数量有限，合成标注质量不足，限制了大规模研究。

Method: NavComposer通过分解语义实体（动作、场景、对象）并重组为自然语言指令，支持数据无关的导航轨迹适应；NavInstrCritic提供无标注评估，涵盖对比匹配、语义一致性和语言多样性。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，支持更广泛的研究应用。

Conclusion: NavComposer和NavInstrCritic解决了指令生成和评估的局限性，推动了语言导航研究的可扩展性和通用性。

Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents
to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However,
expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized
annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale
research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for
automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer
explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects,
and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular
architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while
the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy
of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting
adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.
Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive
annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on
three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic
diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction
quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on
expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from
specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable
research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the
effectiveness of our method.

*Yicong Wu,Ting Chen,Irit Hochberg,Zhoujian Sun,Ruth Edry,Zhengxing Huang,Mor Peleg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于大语言模型（LLM）的多代理系统（MAS）在慢性多病共存患者治疗推荐中的可行性和价值，模拟多学科团队（MDT）决策，结果显示单代理系统表现与MDT相当，但仍存在建议不完整和不必要药物的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性多病共存患者的治疗推荐因治疗冲突风险而具有挑战性，现有决策支持系统存在可扩展性限制，研究旨在探索LLM-MAS系统的潜力。

Method: 设计了单代理和MAS框架，模拟MDT决策，通过LLM代理间的讨论解决医疗冲突，并在多病共存患者的治疗规划任务上进行评估。

Result: 当前LLM下，单代理GP表现与MDT相当，最佳模型能提供满足所有临床目标的正确建议，但建议不完整且存在不必要药物。

Conclusion: LLM-MAS系统在多病共存治疗推荐中具有潜力，但仍需改进建议完整性和减少不必要药物。

Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is
challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support
systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general
practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening
multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the
feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent
system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and
a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM
agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy
planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared
MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An
important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics
that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of
clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold
standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP
performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct
recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are
incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in
unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型在序列生成中具有优势，但也可能生成有害序列，带来生物安全和伦理挑战。

Method: 结合蛋白质安全知识图谱，采用图剪枝策略和强化学习优化序列生成。

Result: KPO显著降低有害序列生成概率，同时保持高功能性。

Conclusion: KPO为生物技术中生成模型的应用提供了安全保证。

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence
generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and
denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of
generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral
transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical
biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior
knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an
efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs
reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins.
Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of
producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a
robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in
biotechnology.

Result: 模型预测鸟类分布的准确率为85%。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解鸟类迁徙提供了一种可扩展且可靠的工具。

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts
away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a
solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific
habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
(O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery
and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to
predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial
characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and
urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data.
Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%,
offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

Result: 在四个真实数学学习任务中验证了ExRec的有效性，并能泛化到新问题，生成可解释的学习轨迹。

Conclusion: ExRec展示了知识追踪引导的强化学习在教育个性化中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise
recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds
on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate
student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key
aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential,
structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents
an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their
semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard
Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value
estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in
estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of
our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different
educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec
generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces
interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight
the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Result: 仿真和消融实验验证，该方法相比基线模型胜率超过80%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类指挥官认知过程，实现了高适应性和可解释性的全链条感知到决策推理。

Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving
multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant
challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the
complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement
learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic
decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language
model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent
perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method
integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight
large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and
decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and
interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods,
the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting
the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments
validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared
with baseline models.

Conclusion: F2STrans为LLM代码翻译提供了有效的优化方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code
translation tasks. However, ensuring both the correctness and readability of
translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in
real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a
function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the
performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:
(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using
high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,
and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating
both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel
code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test
cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive
functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and
existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code
translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform
prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code
translation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决实物资产与区块链系统之间的桥梁问题，同时满足严格的合规性、流动性和风险管理需求。

Method: 结合链上智能合约和链下AI代理，设计四个协作代理（合规、代币发行、做市和风险控制）及协调核心。

Result: 原型实现1.2秒内按需代币发行，做市代理在波动条件下保持0.5%以内的价差，系统可扩展至每秒5000笔交易。

Conclusion: 基于AI代理的去中心化交易所可满足高性能和安全要求，为传统非流动性资产提供民主化访问。

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires
bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict
requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present
GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized
AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold
into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart
contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision
making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the
flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents
(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a
coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled
pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token
issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The
Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5
percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:
an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a
simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user
impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000
concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based
decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance
and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing
access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model --
multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters
-- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system
integrity.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI focuses on integrating learning and reasoning, in

existence of an alphabet soup of neurosymbolic AI systems, the field is lacking
a generally accepted formal definition of what neurosymbolic models and
inference really are. We introduce a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI
that makes abstraction of its key ingredients. More specifically, we define
neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a
logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition
makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains,
like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour
in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where
systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose
in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of
trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and
good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting
information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making
based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the
literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit
the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like
perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems
are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define
aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use
Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and
propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and
allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

Motivation: 传统的静态时序分析虽然计算速度快，但只能提供延迟的上界，可能导致处理器性能未被充分利用。

Method: 将计算实际最大延迟的问题建模为答案集编程（ASP），并提出非平凡的编码方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASP能够有效解决硬件设计中的复杂问题。

Conclusion: ASP是一种可行的解决方案，可用于提升硬件设计中的性能优化。

Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum
delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is
crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an
Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to
perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,
synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum
clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static
Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can
be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead
to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In
this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum
delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally
hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring
extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem
into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address
complex problems in hardware design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱推理方法因全局和局部信息堆叠处理导致分数过平滑，影响推理效果。

Method: DuetGraph采用双路径机制分离全局（注意力）和局部（消息传递）信息处理，并通过粗到细优化策略划分高低分实体子集。

Result: 实验表明DuetGraph在推理质量和训练效率上均优于现有方法，推理质量提升8.7%，训练效率加速1.8倍。

Conclusion: DuetGraph通过双路径融合和粗到细优化有效解决了分数过平滑问题，实现了知识图谱推理的SOTA性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across
various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and
local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods
often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between
correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address
this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with
dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by
segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message
passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,
preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.
In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which
partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the
candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which
alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments
on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a
1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic
systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex,
adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling
powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of
uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and
fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations
practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing,
analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We
identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site
reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the
system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation
Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric
collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations,
and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of
automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not
by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and
effective operation.

Conclusion: Opus框架显著提高了工作流生成质量，尤其在混合意图场景下表现优异。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to
improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language
Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user
queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention
Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,
interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating
Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables
LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query
complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent
query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to
Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow
similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention
Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to
LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable
LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow
Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the
proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to
direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention
Elicitation.

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟推荐系统和多层感知器的合成EW-QBAFs中有效。

Conclusion: G-RAEs和迭代算法为EW-QBAFs的可争议性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human
preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support
contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks
(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs
can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability
problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)
to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a
topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation
attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic
argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing
interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building
on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the
edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach
experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural
characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer
perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

Conclusion: CogDDN通过模拟人类认知机制显著提升了导航准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead
of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical
decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous
replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics
plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume
an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for
uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle
uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to
entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they
remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety
and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility
of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.
It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies
its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive
clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A
lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,
surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency
by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward
certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合代码文本建模与结构化建模优势的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的代码LLMs在分析代码的结构化属性（如控制流和数据流）方面存在局限性，而现有结构化方法缺乏现代LLMs的生成能力和规模。

Method: 结合代码文本建模与结构化建模的优势，提出一种新方法。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 新方法有望弥补现有LLMs在结构化代码分析上的不足，同时保留其生成能力。

Abstract: Code LLMs have become extremely popular recently for modeling source code
across a variety of tasks, such as generation, translation, and summarization.
However, transformer-based models are limited in their capabilities to reason
through structured, analytical properties of code, such as control and data
flow. Previous work has explored the modeling of these properties with
structured data and graph neural networks. However, these approaches lack the
generative capabilities and scale of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach to combine the strengths of modeling both code as text and more
structured forms.

misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is
imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows
promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and
investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT
monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers

Abstract: AI-enhanced Extended Reality (XR) aims to deliver adaptive, immersive

experiential evolution. PAiR employs these models in a closed-loop system
linking dynamic user states with immersive environments. We present PAiR's
architecture, detailing its modules and system flow, and demonstrate its

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义强化学习的三个核心信条（代理、学习目标和奖励假设），以解决理论和实践中的问题。

Method: 借鉴开放进化理论，重新审视三个信条，并结合进化动力学和起源理论进行分析。

Result: 进化理论可以丰富学习视角，但代理问题需结合起源理论解决。

Conclusion: 进化理论为强化学习提供了新视角，但代理问题需进一步整合起源理论。

Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition
of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward
hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with
major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired
by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We
revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To
make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first
establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains
over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational
processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary
insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We
then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,
using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.
multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration
in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence
of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the
evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it
gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from
origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication
offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained
reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Method: 引入IFScale基准测试，包含500条关键词包含指令，评估20个前沿模型在高指令密度下的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在500条指令时准确率为68%，模型规模和推理能力与性能下降模式相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于设计高指令密度提示，并揭示了性能与延迟的权衡，所有数据和结果已开源。

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even
hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following
capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been
characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a
single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500
keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure
how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density
increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers
and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the
max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning
capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias
towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following
errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in
real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs.
We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTTM方法依赖静态配置或黄金参考，难以在商业生产线中实现，且无法适应异构设备环境。

Method: 提出基于数据方差和模式数量的新TTTM分析流程，包括单变量和多变量方法。

Result: 最佳单变量方法在方差和模式数量上的相关系数分别>0.95和>0.5；多变量方法与最佳单变量方法的相关系数>0.75。

Conclusion: 新方法在TTTM中表现有效，多变量方法对超参数敏感。

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber
matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional
TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden
reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line.
Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting,
where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different
equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these
issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance
and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves
a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes,
respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best
multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the
top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm
hyper-parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准交叉熵损失函数在分类任务中可能存在优化不足的问题，因此提出改进方法以提升性能。

Method: 在标准交叉熵损失函数中增加一个与真实类预测概率相关的项，形成线性自适应交叉熵损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上使用ResNet模型测试，新损失函数在分类准确率上优于标准交叉熵损失函数，且效率相近。

Conclusion: 新损失函数简单有效，为未来损失函数设计提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel
measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard
cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that
depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to
enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot
encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based
model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed
one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms
of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity,
achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy
loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for
future research into loss function design.

TL;DR: VolSched是一种新型自适应学习率调度器，通过动态调整学习率以优化深度神经网络训练，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预定义和自适应学习率调度器可能导致次优泛化性能，因此需要更有效的动态调整方法。

Method: 利用长期和短期精度波动比率动态调整学习率，以逃离平台期或稳定训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，VolSched显著提升ResNet-18和ResNet-34的准确率，并找到更平坦的损失最小值。

Conclusion: VolSched通过动态调整学习率，有效提升模型泛化性能，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Effective learning rate (LR) scheduling is crucial for training deep neural
networks. However, popular pre-defined and adaptive schedulers can still lead
to suboptimal generalization. This paper introduces VolSched, a novel adaptive
LR scheduler inspired by the concept of volatility in stochastic processes like
Geometric Brownian Motion to dynamically adjust the learning rate. By
calculating the ratio between long-term and short-term accuracy volatility,
VolSched increases the LR to escape plateaus and decreases it to stabilize
training, allowing the model to explore the loss landscape more effectively. We
evaluate VolSched on the CIFAR-100 dataset against a strong baseline using a
standard augmentation pipeline. When paired with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, our
scheduler delivers consistent performance gains, improving top-1 accuracy by
1.4 and 1.3 percentage points respectively. Analysis of the loss curves reveals
that VolSched promotes a longer exploration phase. A quantitative analysis of
the Hessian shows that VolSched finds a final solution that is 38% flatter than
the next-best baseline, allowing the model to obtain wider minima and hence
better generalization performance.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习和Transformer在多个领域取得了成功，但其理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 回顾了线性代数、概率和优化的关键概念，详细分析了多头自注意力机制和反向传播算法。

Result: 证明了单层Transformer（包含一个自注意力层和ReLU激活的前馈网络）可以近似任意连续序列到序列映射。

Conclusion: 研究结果推动了Transformer模型的理论理解，缩小了理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the
backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many
domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer.
Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based
models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT
and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology.
However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this
paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and
Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts
from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning,
and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation
algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem
for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one
self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU
activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a
compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a
complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical
implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding
of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征选择研究缺乏统一的基准测试和公开数据集，影响了可重复性和性能。

Method: 开发了MH-FSF框架，包含17种特征选择方法（11种经典，6种领域特定），并在10个公开的Android恶意软件数据集上进行了系统评估。

Result: 结果显示不同数据集上性能存在差异，强调了数据预处理和选择标准的重要性。

Conclusion: MH-FSF框架为特征选择方法提供了统一的比较平台，推动了方法学的一致性和严谨性，为Android恶意软件检测等领域的研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it
reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research
often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets.
This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a
comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the
reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through
collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11
classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly
available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations
across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need
for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these
asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing
diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and
rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the
existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature
selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

Result: 在14个真实数据集上进行了实验，包括CER趋势、消融研究、敏感性分析和时间集成动态。

Conclusion: 本文为复杂、弱监督的流数据在线学习提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible
learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still
faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data
streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric
modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an
abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often
infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To
address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed,
Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent
copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via
ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware
pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF.
It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling,
drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of
experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios.
These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal
ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for
online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

Motivation: 属性缺失图的深度图聚类在实际应用中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用节点邻域信息，导致结果不可靠。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的图数据集上，DTRGC显著提升了属性缺失图下各种DGC方法的聚类性能。

Conclusion: DTRGC通过分层填补和聚类信息修正，有效解决了属性缺失图的深度图聚类问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised
task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct
clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical
applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing
imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the
varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to
unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood.
To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph
Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known
neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to
iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering
information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware
Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting
propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently,
Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing
nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood
attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups
with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster
structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors.
Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information
across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node
representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show
that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC
methods under attribute-missing graphs.

Conclusion: RedOne在SNS领域表现出强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking
services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant
challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement.
Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential
solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only
encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios
but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these
challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the
performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive
foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training
strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and
preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through
extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and
achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56%
in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore,
through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content
detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by
14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results
establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating
excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: DALI-PD为物理设计中的机器学习研究提供了高效的数据生成工具。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various
physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by
the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such
datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very
few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate,
and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD,
a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML
in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout
heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop,
congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a
dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts
and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML
accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

Abstract: The United Arab Emirates (UAE) relies heavily on seawater desalination to
meet over 90% of its drinking water needs. Desalination processes are highly
energy intensive and account for approximately 15% of the UAE's electricity
consumption, contributing to over 22% of the country's energy-related CO2
emissions. Moreover, these processes face significant sustainability challenges
in the face of climate uncertainties such as rising seawater temperatures,
salinity, and aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD greatly affects the operational
and economic performance of solar-powered desalination systems through
photovoltaic soiling, membrane fouling, and water turbidity cycles.
  This study proposes a novel pipelined two-stage predictive modelling
architecture: the first stage forecasts AOD using satellite-derived time series
and meteorological data; the second stage uses the predicted AOD and other
meteorological factors to predict desalination performance efficiency losses.
The framework achieved 98% accuracy, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to reveal key drivers of system degradation. Furthermore, this study
proposes a dust-aware rule-based control logic for desalination systems based
on predicted values of AOD and solar efficiency. This control logic is used to
adjust the desalination plant feed water pressure, adapt maintenance
scheduling, and regulate energy source switching.
  To enhance the practical utility of the research findings, the predictive
models and rule-based controls were packaged into an interactive dashboard for
scenario and predictive analytics. This provides a management decision-support
system for climate-adaptive planning.

TL;DR: FedGSCA是一种新的联邦学习框架，旨在解决医学图像分类中的标签噪声问题，通过全局样本选择器和客户端自适应调整机制提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学联邦学习中标签噪声和数据不平衡问题导致模型性能下降，现有方法难以应对噪声异质性。

Method: 提出FedGSCA框架，结合全局样本选择器和客户端自适应调整机制，动态处理噪声和类别分布。

Result: 在多种噪声条件下，FedGSCA优于现有方法，尤其在极端和异质噪声场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: FedGSCA显著提升模型稳定性和噪声处理能力，适用于实际医学联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image
classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which
arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training
instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with
noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these
challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in
noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates
noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity
and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive
Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label
generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class
distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully
managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual
approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during
local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate
FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical
datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric,
extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise
scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving
model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for
real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Motivation: 传统扩展定律在大语言模型中表现不佳，出现性能提升减缓的现象（次优扩展），研究旨在探索其背后的原因。

Method: 通过对400多个模型进行实证分析，研究数据密度和资源分配对性能的影响。

Result: 发现高数据密度和次优资源分配是导致次优扩展的关键因素，提出了新的扩展定律。

Conclusion: 数据质量和多样性对模型性能至关重要，新定律能更准确预测次优扩展下的表现。

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that
increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent
studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where
performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as
sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of
data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive
empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and
non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling.
High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information,
while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance
improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts
performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality
and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm
design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within
search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms.
However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general
coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored
for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how
well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this
paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring
fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank
based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality,
then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM
outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm
design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform
their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and
match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover,
we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm
design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings.
These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in
algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

Motivation: 理解RL和SFT在训练大型语言模型（LLM）时的动态差异及其对模型能力的影响。

Method: 在同一模型和相似超参数下，比较RL和SFT在数学问题上的表现，并分析模型参数变化。

Result: RL在数学领域有轻微提升，但对知识密集型任务（如MMLU）略有下降；SFT的更新幅度更大，且对中层的MLP影响更显著。

Conclusion: RL可能增强现有能力，而SFT可能替换旧技能；冻结部分模型的效果不确定。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code
datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly
popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a
comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same
model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains
on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU,
while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters
across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights
the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer
MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the
out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of
the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with
benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together,
our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing
capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

Method: 收集了36种预训练算法创新数据，估算其开发总FLOP和硬件FLOP/s，分析计算限制的潜在影响。

Result: 资源需求每年翻倍，但即使严格的计算限制（如GPT-2的训练计算量或8个H100 GPU）仍能实现半数创新。

Conclusion: 计算限制不太可能显著减缓AI算法进步，资源需求增长虽快，但创新仍可在有限计算下实现。

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven
a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of
capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements
for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic
innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate
both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware
utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements
each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps
on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to
dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such
as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping
hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the
cataloged innovations.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习在动态频谱分配中样本复杂度高且存在安全性风险，需要一种更高效、更安全的方法。

Method: 提出了三种元学习架构（MAML、RNN和注意力增强RNN），并在模拟的动态IAB环境中与非元学习的PPO基线进行比较。

Result: 注意力增强的元学习代理峰值吞吐量达48 Mbps，远高于PPO的10 Mbps，同时减少了50%以上的SINR和延迟违规，适应速度快。

Conclusion: 元学习是复杂无线系统中智能控制的高效且安全的选择。

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to
efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample
complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can
cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a
meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy
and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement
three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML),
recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate
them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization
(PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB)
environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based
meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while
the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method
reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also
shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource
allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer
option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for time
series analytics, leveraging their massive parameters and the shared sequential
nature of textual and time series data. However, a cross-modality gap exists
between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual

provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics.
We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups
based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and
fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks.
In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand
the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal
time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency.
Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements,
methodologies, and future research directions in cross-modal time series
analytics.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success
in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language
modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by
leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from
optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory
induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several
trajectory inference techniques under the framework of gradient flow matching,
providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive
bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including
reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent
weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting
informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments
demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating
in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and
supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical
application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts,
where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足球比赛结果预测具有挑战性，现有方法常忽略球员和团队间的异质性交互，HIGFormer旨在填补这一空白。

Method: HIGFormer包含三个部分：Player Interaction Network（编码球员表现）、Team Interaction Network（建模团队历史关系）和Match Comparison Transformer（联合分析团队和球员信息）。

Result: 在WyScout数据集上的实验表明，HIGFormer在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIGFormer不仅提升了预测准确性，还为球员表现评估和团队策略分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently
unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing
results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep
learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective
player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.
However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of
interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling
match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous
Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep
learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a
multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player
dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a
Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through
heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a
global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which
constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model
historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which
jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match
outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a
large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly
outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide
valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,
offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均性能提升约5%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GHPO为开发强大且稳健的推理模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language
models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,
prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training
instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty
mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's
current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled
learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more
resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning
framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive
prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively
balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's
reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,
effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of
approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently
outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning
baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances
both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a
scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning
models.

Result: 在CMU运动捕捉数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持分割性能的同时，速度提升了约278倍。

Conclusion: RFF-GP-HSMM是一种高效的时间序列分割方法，适用于大规模数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series
segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address
the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model
(GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring
inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number
of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a
significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method
approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving
expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix.
Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance
comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster
segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points
and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face
computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention
mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper
proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network
specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach
introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention
mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest
neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$
to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory
regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet
extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with
1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3
seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds
high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared
to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method
improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a

approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability.
We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two
complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that
preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing
Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that
progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the
Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and
stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP
thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a
clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be
measured.

Abstract: We introduce a novel classification framework, ZClassifier, that replaces
conventional deterministic logits with diagonal Gaussian-distributed logits.
Our method simultaneously addresses temperature scaling and manifold
approximation by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted Gaussian distributions and a unit isotropic Gaussian. This unifies
uncertainty calibration and latent control in a principled probabilistic
manner, enabling a natural interpretation of class confidence and geometric
consistency. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that ZClassifier
improves over softmax classifiers in robustness, calibration, and latent
separation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness for classifier-guided
generation by interpreting logits as Gaussian semantic potentials.

namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly
in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these
models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work
uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network
to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify
species. Training is rapid ($3$\,ms), as only one representative signal is
required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only
$5.4$\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat
recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with
a small memory footprint of $144.09$\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low
computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard
personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing
devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\%$ precision on the
dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of
disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides.
Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this
first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model
is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that
has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable,
transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.

Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human
cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems
with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical
generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement
symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of
radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a
group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining
characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder,
when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our
analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and
we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit
differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks
in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition
using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a
function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can
achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function,
and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We
then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

Motivation: SPN的参数估计在协变量依赖和显式似然不可得时具有挑战性，尤其是在部分观测条件下。

Method: 使用轻量级1D卷积残差网络，通过端到端训练从Gillespie模拟的SPN实现中学习系统动态的反演。

Result: 在20%事件缺失的合成SPN上，替代模型的RMSE为0.108，且运行速度显著快于传统贝叶斯方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的无似然替代模型能够实现复杂、部分观测离散事件系统中准确、鲁棒和实时的参数恢复。

Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for
modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems
biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in
particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit
likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate
(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework
that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions
directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a
lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on
Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under
realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout
provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On
synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function
coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than
traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven,
likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter
recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.

Result: 在数据污染和分布偏移下，方法实现了O(√ε)的估计误差。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为数据污染和分布偏移双重挑战下的学习提供了严格的理论保证和高效计算方法。

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a framework for
decision-making under distributional uncertainty, yet its effectiveness can be
compromised by outliers in the training data. This paper introduces a
principled approach to simultaneously address both challenges. We focus on
optimizing Wasserstein-1 DRO objectives for generalized linear models with
convex Lipschitz loss functions, where an $\epsilon$-fraction of the training
data is adversarially corrupted. Our primary contribution lies in a novel
modeling framework that integrates robustness against training data
contamination with robustness against distributional shifts, alongside an
efficient algorithm inspired by robust statistics to solve the resulting
optimization problem. We prove that our method achieves an estimation error of
$O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the true DRO objective value using only the
contaminated data under the bounded covariance assumption. This work
establishes the first rigorous guarantees, supported by efficient computation,
for learning under the dual challenges of data contamination and distributional
shifts.

Abstract: Grounding language in complex perception (e.g. pixels) and action is a key
challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans via
language. In past works, this is often solved via manual design of the language
grounding or by curating massive datasets relating language to elements of the
environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, a neurosymbolic framework for
grounding formal language from data, and eliciting behaviours by directly
tasking RL agents through this language. By virtue of data-driven learning, our
framework avoids the manual design of domain-specific elements like reward
functions or symbol detectors. By virtue of compositional formal language
semantics, our framework achieves data-efficient grounding and generalization
to arbitrary language compositions. Experiments on an image-based gridworld and
a MuJoCo robotics domain show that our approach reliably maps formal language
instructions to behaviours with limited data while end-to-end, data-driven
approaches fail.

Abstract: This work aims to address the problem of long-term dynamic forecasting in
complex environments where data are noisy and irregularly sampled. While recent
studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these
approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term
extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,
we propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics
knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in
complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture
long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical
systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization
ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially
known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system
dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a
Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce
a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align
with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the
solutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world
applications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and
COVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of
Phy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation
tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/511205787/Phy_SSM-ICML2025.

Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of multi-armed sampling, as the sampling
counterpart to the optimization problem of multi-arm bandits. Our primary
motivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in
the context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret
for this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a
simple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical
results demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require
exploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits,
we define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that
smoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit
problems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling
framework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the
study of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of
multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning. In particular, our work sheds
light on the need for exploration and the convergence properties of algorithm
for entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, fine-tuning of pretrained
models and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).

Conclusion: 新框架能有效捕捉外域干预下的因果动态变化，为跨域因果推断提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between event pairs in a temporal sequence is
applicable in many domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, and
transportation. Most existing work on causal inference primarily focuses on
event types within the designated domain, without considering the impact of
exogenous out-of-domain interventions. In real-world settings, these
out-of-domain interventions can significantly alter causal dynamics. To address
this gap, we propose a new causal framework to define average treatment effect
(ATE), beyond independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data in classic
Rubin's causal framework, to capture the causal relation shift between events
of temporal process under out-of-domain intervention. We design an unbiased ATE
estimator, and devise a Transformer-based neural network model to handle both
long-range temporal dependencies and local patterns while integrating
out-of-domain intervention information into process modeling. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms baselines in ATE estimation and goodness-of-fit under
out-of-domain-augmented point processes.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation
using contextual bandits, introducing SC-LinUCB and proving it achieves lower
regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide
parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is
critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning)
and non-stationary (robust adaptation) settings. Third, we propose the FiReAct
pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based
retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space.
These findings provide a comprehensive guide to building more sample-efficient,
adaptive, and scalable orchestration agents.

Abstract: Assortment optimization involves selecting a subset of substitutable products
(subject to certain constraints) to maximize the expected revenue. It is a
classic problem in revenue management and finds applications across various
industries. However, the problem is usually NP-hard due to its combinatorial
and non-linear nature. In this work, we explore how graph concolutional
networks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment
optimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a
graph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the
patterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies
based on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize
across inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale
instances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments
demonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20
products), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+
optimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within
seconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and
efficiency. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a model-free setting where
the underlying choice model is unknown but transaction data is available. We
also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our proposed policies in this setting.

Abstract: To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be
resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this
form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we
introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term
group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents
is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to
environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different
collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our
experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher
group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a
static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data
collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is
distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset
distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To
mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many
existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the
$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the
Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures
the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks
(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the
Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding
adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates
comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL
benchmark dataset. The code is available at

Abstract: Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving
reinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.
Despite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world
reappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily
verbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is
often impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the
effectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based
augmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image
diffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we
introduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via
spoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally
congruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned
IP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'
reappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,
externalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we
conducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive
emotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive
images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without
AI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal
significantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control
conditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between
participant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,
suggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These
findings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive
reappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
affective computing, and therapeutic technology.

Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which
play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport.
Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for
understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational
challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional
approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent
properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state
parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for
computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a
Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is
specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in
neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent
representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration
profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global
graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent
space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the
Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration
of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models
with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component
effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in
recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated
through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport

*Souvik Nath,Sumit Wadhwa,Luiz Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于编码器-解码器架构的小型语言模型（SLM），用于改进产品和服务的税务代码预测，解决了多国税务合规中的复杂性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨国企业每天处理大量交易，需遵守不同司法管辖区的税务规定，准确预测税务代码（如HSN或SAC）对避免税务处罚至关重要。

Method: 采用基于编码器-解码器架构的SLM，利用非结构化数据预测层次化税务代码序列，捕捉代码间的依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在结构化税务代码序列预测中表现优于扁平分类器、仅解码器或仅编码器架构。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于HSN，还可扩展至其他政府规定的税务代码（如UNSPSC或NCM），为税务合规领域提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).

Conclusion: SiGMoID在科学研究和工程系统中具有广泛应用前景，能揭示完整系统动态。

Abstract: System inference for nonlinear dynamic models, represented by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), remains a significant challenge in many fields,
particularly when the data are noisy, sparse, or partially observable. In this
paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data
(SiGMoID) that enables precise and robust inference for dynamic systems. The
proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural
networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein
generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively
capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data
noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components.
Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental
examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from
scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full
system dynamics.

Motivation: AI模型需要遗忘以满足法律要求（如AI法案或GDPR），并解决有毒内容、去偏见等问题，但遗忘可能导致性能下降。本文探讨了对抗性遗忘问题。

Method: 研究了对抗性遗忘现象及其影响因素，提出了一种保护模型性能的新方法。

Result: 对抗性遗忘的效果取决于模型本身和遗忘数据的选择策略。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新方法，能有效保护模型性能免受对抗性遗忘的影响。

Abstract: AI models need to be unlearned to fulfill the requirements of legal acts such
as the AI Act or GDPR, and also because of the need to remove toxic content,
debiasing, the impact of malicious instances, or changes in the data
distribution structure in which a model works. Unfortunately, removing
knowledge may cause undesirable side effects, such as a deterioration in model
performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial
unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to
deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and
the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone
model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned. The
main result of this work is a new method of protecting model performance from
these side effects, both in the case of unlearned behavior resulting from
spontaneous processes and adversary actions.

Motivation: 准确建模库存消耗和运输成本对区域库存规划至关重要，尤其是在使用强化学习开发控制策略时。现有方法（如直接调用内部系统）不可微且效率低。

Method: 将问题转化为概率预测问题，建模所有仓库在每个时间段的消耗量和运输成本的联合分布，考虑库存位置和外部客户需求。

Result: 初步结果表明模型在分布内设置下具有准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型和验证方案适用于强化学习环境，能够处理非分布场景，并通过生产系统评估反事实库存状态。

Abstract: We study the problem of forecasting the number of units fulfilled (or
``drained'') from each inventory warehouse to meet customer demand, along with
the associated outbound shipping costs. The actual drain and shipping costs are
determined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution
of customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be
delivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for
regional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated
into a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be
differentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can
be used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow
and costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this
as a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of
outbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,
conditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure
robustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution
scenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation
scheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on
counterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies. Preliminary results
demonstrate the model's accuracy within the in-distribution setting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于类别难度可分性的数据剪枝方法，通过引入类别难度可分性系数（CDSC）和类别比例采样策略，显著提升了数据剪枝的效果，尤其在噪声和不平衡数据集中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法假设数据难度在类别间均匀分布，忽略了类别间难度差异，导致在真实场景（如网络入侵检测和医学影像）中性能下降。

Method: 提出类别难度可分性概念和CDSC量化指标，并设计类别比例采样策略（如CCS-CP），以解决类别间难度差异问题。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，类别比例方法在极端剪枝率（99%）下仍保持稳定性能（如精度仅下降0.49%），显著优于类别无关方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模类别难度可分性可提升数据剪枝的鲁棒性和泛化能力，尤其适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient
machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning
the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often
relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most
existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,
overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such
as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often
clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and
introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a
quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with
performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to
overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.
  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple
sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and
medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data
efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a
class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows
remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and
recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best
method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and
4.11% in recall.
  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,
imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly
modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and
generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归解码器在肽段从头测序中存在级联错误和未能有效利用高置信区域的问题，扩散解码器提供了一种新的解决方案。

Method: 研究采用了三种扩散解码器设计、背包束搜索和多种损失函数，并与基线自回归解码器模型Casanovo进行比较。

Result: 尽管肽段精确率和召回率仍为0，但最佳扩散解码器设计结合DINOISER损失函数在氨基酸召回率上显著提高了0.373。

Conclusion: 扩散解码器在提高模型敏感性和推动肽段从头测序技术进步方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Peptide de novo sequencing is a method used to reconstruct amino acid
sequences from tandem mass spectrometry data without relying on existing
protein sequence databases. Traditional deep learning approaches, such as
Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids
sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to
leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this
paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data
domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence
generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction
accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,
knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search
did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer
decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide
precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the
DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in
amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive
decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of
diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive
significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.

contributions of this study include establishing a clear pathway for future
research in integrating physics-informed ML frameworks, addressing existing
methodological gaps, and ultimately improving precision, scalability, and
operational efficiency within semiconductor manufacturing.

Conclusion: StellarF为天体物理研究和跨学科应用提供了新方法框架。

Abstract: Stellar flare forecasting, a critical research frontier in astronomy, offers
profound insights into stellar activity. However, the field is constrained by
both the sparsity of recorded flare events and the absence of domain-specific
large-scale predictive models. To address these challenges, this study
introduces StellarF (Stellar Flare Forecasting), a novel large model that
leverages Low-Rank (LoRA) and Adapter techniques to parameter-efficient
learning for stellar flare forecasting. At its core, StellarF integrates an
flare statistical information module with a historical flare record module,
enabling multi-scale pattern recognition from observational data. Extensive
experiments on our self-constructed datasets (derived from Kepler and TESS
light curves) demonstrate that StellarF achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing methods. The proposed prediction paradigm establishes a
novel methodological framework for advancing astrophysical research and
cross-disciplinary applications.

Result: 实验表明，AAPS在离散控制任务中实现了高样本效率，且显著减少了权重更新次数。

Conclusion: ClusterEnv无缝集成到现有RL流程中，支持多种策略方法，且代码改动最小。

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) workloads often requires distributing
environment simulation across compute clusters. Existing frameworks entangle
simulation, learning logic, and orchestration into monolithic systems, limiting
modularity and reusability. We present ClusterEnv, a lightweight,
learner-agnostic interface for distributed environment execution that mirrors
the Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv introduces the DETACH pattern, which decouples
simulation from training by offloading reset() and step() operations to remote
workers while keeping learning centralized. To address policy staleness in
distributed execution, we propose Adaptive Actor Policy Synchronization (AAPS),
a divergence-triggered update mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead
without sacrificing performance. ClusterEnv integrates cleanly into existing RL
pipelines, supports both on-policy and off-policy methods, and requires minimal
code changes. Experiments on discrete control tasks demonstrate that AAPS
achieves high sample efficiency with significantly fewer weight updates. Source

Method: 通过一个简单的示例，论文展示了终端目标和工具目标的混淆如何导致奖励函数的错误优化。

Result: 结果表明，即使轻微的混淆也会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 结论强调了在奖励函数设计中区分终端目标和工具目标的重要性，以避免强化学习中的对齐问题。

Abstract: Reward functions, learned or manually specified, are rarely perfect. Instead
of accurately expressing human goals, these reward functions are often
distorted by human beliefs about how best to achieve those goals. Specifically,
these reward functions often express a combination of the human's terminal
goals -- those which are ends in themselves -- and the human's instrumental
goals -- those which are means to an end. We formulate a simple example in
which even slight conflation of instrumental and terminal goals results in
severe misalignment: optimizing the misspecified reward function results in
poor performance when measured by the true reward function. This example
distills the essential properties of environments that make reinforcement
learning highly sensitive to conflation of instrumental and terminal goals. We
discuss how this issue can arise with a common approach to reward learning and
how it can manifest in real environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的异构性（混合分类和数值特征）使得对抗攻击难以定义不可察觉的修改，传统梯度方法生成的对抗样本易偏离原始数据分布。

Method: 使用混合输入VAE将分类嵌入和数值特征整合到统一潜在流形中，生成统计一致的对抗样本，并提出In-Distribution Success Rate（IDSR）作为评估指标。

Result: 在六个公开数据集和三种模型架构上的实验表明，该方法比传统输入空间攻击和其他基于VAE的方法表现更优，异常率更低。

Conclusion: 研究表明，潜在空间扰动对表格数据的对抗攻击至关重要，该方法在实际部署中具有优越性，且重建质量是关键因素。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct
from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical
and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual
similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it
difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional
gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing
adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making
them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a
mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial
examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical
features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve
statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to
measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly
available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method
achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance
compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted
from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes
hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative
architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically
on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient
training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold
perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a
robust approach for practical deployment. The source code can be accessed

Motivation: 现有基于补偿的权重校准方法假设一阶项可忽略，但研究发现渐进补偿过程会引入累积的一阶偏差，导致假设不成立。

Method: FOEM通过直接计算潜在权重与全精度权重的差异近似梯度，避免反向传播的高成本，并利用预计算的Cholesky因子实时恢复Hessian子矩阵的逆。

Result: 在3位权重量化中，FOEM将Llama3-8B的困惑度降低89.6%，并将Llama3-70B的5-shot MMLU准确率从51.7%提升至74.9%。

Conclusion: FOEM在多种模型和基准测试中表现优于GPTQ，并能与先进技术无缝集成，进一步缩小与全精度基线的差距。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing
large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and
computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods
often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,
under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained
full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation
process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights
and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally
flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly
incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error
compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference
between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited
generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach
introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages
precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian
submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models
and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical
GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of
Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from
51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.
Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as
GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging
W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision
baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is

Result: 实验表明，AdaMuon在多种模型规模和学习率下均优于原始Muon，收敛更快且稳定。

Conclusion: AdaMuon无需额外调参，可直接集成到现有Muon训练流程中，是一种高效且稳定的优化方法。

Abstract: We propose AdaMuon, an adaptive learning-rate framework built upon the
recently validated Muon optimizer, which has demonstrated substantial
efficiency gains over AdamW in large-scale model training. AdaMuon augments
Muon with two mutually dependent modules: (1) a per-parameter second-moment
modulation that captures orthogonal gradient updates to ensure update-level
adaptivity, and (2) a RMS-aligned rescaling that regulates the overall update
magnitude by aligning it with the intrinsic structure of the parameter space.
Empirical results on multiple model scales and learning-rate regimes confirm
that AdaMuon consistently outperforms the original Muon, delivering higher
acceleration in convergence while maintaining training stability. Our method
introduces no additional tuning burden and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing Muon training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备运行大型语言模型（LLMs）面临通信带宽和计算资源限制，现有LoRA方法的固定或启发式秩配置及参数传输效率低下。

Method: AirLLM将秩配置建模为结构化动作向量，使用PPO生成粗粒度决策，并通过DDIM细化生成高分辨率秩向量，两者交替优化。

Result: 在不同信噪比下，AirLLM显著降低了传输成本并提升了微调性能。

Conclusion: AirLLM通过强化学习和扩散模型实现了高效、可扩展的远程微调，为边缘设备上的LLMs提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly
challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and
memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.
Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ
fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air
transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address
this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework
for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank
configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted
projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential
decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates
coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic
complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The
two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.
Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM
consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing
transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,
diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning
over the air.

Abstract: This study explores the potential for predicting turbulent kinetic energy

and turbulence data collected concurrently at 10 Hz during a small experimental
prescribed burn in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Machine learning models,
including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and
Gaussian Process Regressor, were employed to assess the potential to predict
TKE from temperature perturbations and explore temporal and spatial dynamics of
correlations. Data visualization and correlation analyses revealed patterns and
relationships between thermocouple temperatures and TKE, providing insight into
the underlying dynamics. More accurate predictions of TKE were achieved by
employing various machine learning models despite a weak correlation between

Conclusion: REPPO成功结合了路径策略梯度的样本效率和在线学习的简单性，为策略优化提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in
game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance
often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy
gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by
an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to
train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to
construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training
Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using
pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to
balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for
stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that
facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we
propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient
on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy
gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard
on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical
performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint
as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two
standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.

Motivation: 室内定位对智能环境和导航系统至关重要，但现有方法因噪声分布和设备异构性导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出GATE框架，结合注意力超空间向量（AHV）、多维超空间向量（MDHV）和实时边构建（RTEC），动态适应噪声和设备变化。

Conclusion: GATE通过创新的图表示和向量方法，显著提升了室内定位的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart
environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)
fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its
compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve
accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but
they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to
incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of
real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous
mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS
readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models
by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal
relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise
distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded
accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these
challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive
graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor
state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to
mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces
1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a
novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind
spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic
graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor
spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices
demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and
1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor
localization frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数学距离度量方法，用于比较混合整数线性规划（MILP）实例，解决了现有相似性度量精度不足和依赖标签数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MILP缺乏有效的实例比较结构，现有相似性度量精度不足且依赖标签数据，限制了其应用和泛化能力。

Method: 通过离散化右端项、权重和变量，并借鉴Earth mover's distance，提出了一种基于数学公式的距离度量方法。

Result: 实验表明，该度量方法在类别识别中表现优异，贪婪版本在保持高精度的同时速度提升近200倍，优于现有非学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为MILP实例比较提供了有效的数学距离度量，显著提升了性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for addressing a
wide range of real-world problems, but it lacks a clear structure for comparing
instances. A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful
relationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance
set heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when
machine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision
in identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits
their applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived
directly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand
sides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws
inspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in
weight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach
naturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an
exact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,
using the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric
contribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves
accuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times
faster. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including feature-based,
image-based, and neural network models, our unsupervised method consistently
outperforms all non-learned approaches and rivals the performance of a
supervised classifier on class and subclass grouping tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机导航提供了一种高效的时间尺度检测方法，增强了对抗隐蔽欺骗攻击的韧性。

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time
localization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to
sophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to
deceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly
perturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without
triggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional
distributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a
threshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and
timely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are
essential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with
alternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy
adversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point
detection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates
from a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural
deviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal
value-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,
temporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,
achieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative
rates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度正则化的神经格兰杰因果模型（GRNGC），解决了现有方法计算成本高和捕捉复杂交互能力弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经格兰杰因果模型需要为每个时间序列构建单独模型，计算成本高；且稀疏性惩罚削弱了捕捉复杂交互的能力。

Method: GRNGC仅需一个时间序列预测模型，并在输入与输出的梯度上应用L1正则化以推断因果关系，支持多种架构（如KAN、MLP、LSTM）。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如DREAM、Lorenz-96、基因数据）上，GRNGC优于基线方法，显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: GRNGC是一种灵活高效的神经格兰杰因果模型，适用于复杂交互和实际应用。

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural
network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these
models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most
existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the
construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in
substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing
penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal
relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To
address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural
Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model
and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and
output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific
time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures
such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical
simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC
outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational
overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder
urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in
reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Conclusion: 该方案有效提升了联邦学习的通信效率。

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables multiple
devices (i.e., agents) to train a shared model cooperatively without exchanging
raw data. This technique keeps data localized on user devices, ensuring privacy
and security, while each agent trains the model on their own data and only
shares model updates. The communication overhead is a significant challenge due
to the frequent exchange of model updates between the agents and the central
server. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient federated learning
scheme that utilizes low-rank approximation of neural network gradients and
quantization to significantly reduce the network load of the decentralized
learning process with minimal impact on the model's accuracy.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions
with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional
diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease
risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to
significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease
diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines
classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for
risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035
cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an
additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to
evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random
Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on
real data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression
demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic

Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the
models. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to

Abstract: Online collaborative medical prediction platforms offer convenience and
real-time feedback by leveraging massive electronic health records. However,
growing concerns about privacy and low prediction quality can deter patient
participation and doctor cooperation. In this paper, we first clarify the
privacy attacks, namely attribute attacks targeting patients and model
extraction attacks targeting doctors, and specify the corresponding privacy
principles. We then propose a privacy-preserving mechanism and integrate it
into a novel one-shot distributed learning framework, aiming to simultaneously
meet both privacy requirements and prediction performance objectives. Within
the framework of statistical learning theory, we theoretically demonstrate that
the proposed distributed learning framework can achieve the optimal prediction
performance under specific privacy requirements. We further validate the
developed privacy-preserving collaborative medical prediction platform through
both toy simulations and real-world data experiments.

Abstract: Gradient descent (GD) on logistic regression has many fascinating properties.
When the dataset is linearly separable, it is known that the iterates converge
in direction to the maximum-margin separator regardless of how large the step
size is. In the non-separable case, however, it has been shown that GD can
exhibit a cycling behaviour even when the step sizes is still below the
stability threshold $2/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of
the Hessian at the solution. This short paper explores whether restricting the
data to have equal magnitude is a sufficient condition for global convergence,
under any step size below the stability threshold. We prove that this is true
in a one dimensional space, but in higher dimensions cycling behaviour can
still occur. We hope to inspire further studies on quantifying how common these
cycles are in realistic datasets, as well as finding sufficient conditions to
guarantee global convergence with large step sizes.

Result: 通过新数据集实验和在线A/B测试验证了方法的有效性，并已部署于全球最大电商平台之一。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以显著提升CTR预测性能，未来将公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models are integral to a myriad of
industrial settings, such as personalized search advertising. Current methods
typically involve feature extraction from users' historical behavior sequences
combined with product information, feeding into a discriminative model that is
trained on user feedback to estimate CTR. With the success of models such as
GPT, the potential for generative models to enrich expressive power beyond
discriminative models has become apparent. In light of this, we introduce a
novel model that leverages generative models to enhance the precision of CTR
predictions in discriminative models. To reconcile the disparate data
aggregation needs of both model types, we design a two-stage training process:
1) Generative pre-training for next-item prediction with the given item
category in user behavior sequences; 2) Fine-tuning the well-trained generative
model within a discriminative CTR prediction framework. Our method's efficacy
is substantiated through extensive experiments on a new dataset, and its
significant utility is further corroborated by online A/B testing results.
Currently, the model is deployed on one of the world's largest e-commerce
platforms, and we intend to release the associated code and dataset in the

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex
decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a
substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer,
leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these
challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that
focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the
factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is
computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer,
effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments
across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and
SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents
without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up
to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.

Motivation: 探索SGD在大步长下的最后迭代行为，对过参数化模型训练、持续学习中的遗忘以及随机Kaczmarz方法的收敛性有重要意义。

Method: 在β平滑凸损失函数上运行T步SGD，步长η≤1/β，分析最后迭代的期望超额风险。

Result: 得到最后迭代的期望超额风险为Õ(1/(ηT^(1−βη/2)) + ηT^(βη/2)σ_⋆²)，其中σ_⋆²为最优解处随机梯度的方差。

Conclusion: 在适当步长下，最后迭代的收敛速率接近最优Õ(1/T + σ_⋆/√T)，且在σ_⋆=0时改进为O(1/√T)。

Abstract: We study population convergence guarantees of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for smooth convex objectives in the interpolation regime, where the noise
at optimum is zero or near zero. The behavior of the last iterate of SGD in
this setting -- particularly with large (constant) stepsizes -- has received
growing attention in recent years due to implications for the training of
over-parameterized models, as well as to analyzing forgetting in continual
learning and to understanding the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz method
for solving linear systems. We establish that after $T$ steps of SGD on
$\beta$-smooth convex loss functions with stepsize $\eta \leq 1/\beta$, the
last iterate exhibits expected excess risk $\widetilde{O}(1/(\eta
T^{1-\beta\eta/2}) + \eta T^{\beta\eta/2} \sigma_\star^2)$, where
$\sigma_\star^2$ denotes the variance of the stochastic gradients at the
optimum. In particular, for a well-tuned stepsize we obtain a near optimal
$\widetilde{O}(1/T + \sigma_\star/\sqrt{T})$ rate for the last iterate,
extending the results of Varre et al. (2021) beyond least squares regression;
and when $\sigma_\star=0$ we obtain a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with
$\eta=1/\beta$, improving upon the best-known $O(T^{-1/4})$ rate recently
established by Evron et al. (2025) in the special case of realizable linear
regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在高风险决策中可能放大的不公平偏见问题，确保其可信赖性。

Method: 通过训练一个公平奖励模型（FRM），为LLM的推理过程分配公平性分数，从而在决策中减少偏见。

Result: FRM在无需额外微调的情况下，跨任务、领域和模型家族通用，并在实际任务中提高了公平性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高风险决策中LLM的可信赖使用提供了一种有效途径，平衡了公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used to support high-stakes decisions,
potentially influencing who is granted bail or receives a loan. Naive
chain-of-thought sampling can improve average decision accuracy, but has also
been shown to amplify unfair bias. To address this challenge and enable the
trustworthy use of reasoning models in high-stakes decision-making, we propose
a framework for training a generalizable Fairness Reward Model (FRM). Our model
assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight
biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across
reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on
weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning,
transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional
fine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism
prediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently
improves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy.

### [108] [Neurosymbolic Reasoning Shortcuts under the Independence Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357)
*Emile van Krieken,Pasquale Minervini,Edoardo Ponti,Antonio Vergari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了神经符号（NeSy）预测器中符号概念独立性假设的局限性，指出其可能导致模型无法正确表示某些概念组合的不确定性，从而引发推理捷径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号预测器通常假设符号概念独立以简化概率推理，但近期研究质疑这一假设是否限制了模型的学习能力和不确定性建模。本文旨在澄清这一问题。

Method: 通过形式化分析，证明了符号概念独立性假设会导致模型无法表示某些概念组合的不确定性。

Result: 研究发现，独立性假设使模型无法意识到推理捷径问题，即模型可能因错误原因而做出正确预测。

Conclusion: 独立性假设在神经符号预测器中存在根本性缺陷，可能导致模型无法正确建模不确定性，需重新审视其适用性。

Abstract: The ubiquitous independence assumption among symbolic concepts in
neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors is a convenient simplification: NeSy predictors
use it to speed up probabilistic reasoning. Recent works like van Krieken et
al. (2024) and Marconato et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption
can hinder learning of NeSy predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from
correctly modelling uncertainty. There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy
community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually
limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle
this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic
concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain
concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts,
i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct
downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.

*Daniel Tanneberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无需反向传播的神经网络训练方法，通过前向传播中的局部信号训练每一层，提升了稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中反向传播需要存储激活值且易出现梯度消失或爆炸问题，影响学习效果和稳定性。

Method: 利用多维尺度分析原理设计局部层损失，结合奖励驱动信号，在前向传播中训练每一层。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能上与传统反向传播方法相当，且在稳定性和一致性上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了一种更稳定、高效的神经网络训练方案。

Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on
backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward
pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error
signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding
gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a
novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals
during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,
layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from
multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This
method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed
during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and
storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy
gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this
backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their
classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances
stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance
especially in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPaRK是一个强化学习框架，通过双目标奖励系统优化答案质量和工具多样性，训练语言模型探索多样化工具使用模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高温采样方法限制了工具使用的多样性，SPaRK旨在通过强化学习探索更多工具使用模式。

Method: 采用离线PPO训练Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合GPT-4o评分和稀有工具优先策略，优化工具多样性。

Result: 在14个MMLU-Pro类别中表现优异，工具选择熵显著高于基线方法，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 通过显式工具多样性探索，SPaRK增强推理能力，同时保持准确性。

Abstract: We present Step-wise Policy for Rare-tool Knowledge (SPaRK), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that teaches large language models to explore
diverse tool usage patterns beyond conventional high-temperature sampling.
Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a
dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality
and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on
synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach
uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge
scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought
reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools
to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK
achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting
significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and
supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration
through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without
sacrificing accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合变分自编码器（VAE）和现代Hopfield网络（MHN）的持续学习模型，解决了神经网络中的灾难性遗忘问题，并在Split-MNIST任务上取得了接近90%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够学习新知识而不遗忘旧知识，而神经网络存在灾难性遗忘问题。论文旨在通过结合VAE和MHN，模拟人脑的互补学习系统（CLS）理论，实现持续学习。

Method: 利用VAE的模式完成能力和MHN的模式分离能力，构建了一个神经合理的持续学习模型，并在Split-MNIST任务上进行评估。

Result: 模型在Split-MNIST任务上取得了接近90%的准确率，显著减少了遗忘现象。VAE负责模式完成，MHN负责模式分离。

Conclusion: 通过结合VAE和MHN，论文为生物和人工系统中的记忆巩固、泛化和持续学习提供了功能模板。

Abstract: Learning new information without forgetting prior knowledge is central to
human intelligence. In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic
forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned
tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS)
theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain
has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and
pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture
these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization
capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage
properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally
plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST
task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to
state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting.
Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the
VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By
capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work
provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation,
generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial
systems.

*Seyedsaman Emami,Gonzalo Martínez-Muñoz,Daniel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的多任务梯度提升框架（R-MTGB），通过检测和惩罚异常任务，同时促进相关任务间的知识迁移，提升多任务学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）假设任务间存在有益共享信息，但现实中可能存在异常任务（如对抗性任务），这些任务会降低模型整体性能。因此，需要一种鲁棒的方法来处理任务异质性。

Method: R-MTGB采用三阶段学习框架：1）学习共享模式；2）通过正则化参数划分异常和非异常任务；3）微调任务特定预测器。

Result: 实验表明，R-MTGB能有效隔离异常任务，促进知识迁移，并显著降低各任务的预测误差，整体性能优于基准方法。

Conclusion: R-MTGB在多任务学习环境中表现出鲁棒性、适应性和可靠收敛性，为处理任务异质性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared
information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share
similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms
have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems,
primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and
iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for
learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve
tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which
do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate
the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose
Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that
explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB
structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning
shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with
regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This
architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks
while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method
integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing
robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers
knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task
individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These
results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB
in challenging MTL environments.

*Behtom Adeli,John McLinden,Pankaj Pandey,Ming Shao,Yalda Shahriari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了多种激活函数在fNIRS分类任务中的表现，发现对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x)）在某些架构中优于ReLU，并强调了激活函数选择对fNIRS数据特性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fNIRS领域中的非线性、低信噪比和信号变异性对模型准确性提出了挑战，但激活函数对深度学习性能的影响尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用多种深度学习架构（如fNIRSNet、AbsoluteNet等）和标准化预处理，评估了传统和领域特定的激活函数。

Result: 对称激活函数（如Tanh和Abs(x)）在某些架构中表现优于ReLU，且对称性分析进一步支持其性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择与fNIRS数据特性匹配的激活函数对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,
particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),
where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability
poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of
activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain
remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current
literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific
activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep
learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,
MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset
recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks
were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent
training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions
such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly
used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the
architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was
conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further
supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance
gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation
functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.

TL;DR: iTransformer是目前多变量时间序列预测中最流行和有效的模型之一，但其倒置框架存在局限性。为解决这些问题，作者提出了一种新的数据增强方法DAIF，包括频率过滤和跨变量修补策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iTransformer的倒置框架虽然能有效捕捉多变量相关性，但会削弱时间依赖性信息，并在变量相关性不显著时引入噪声。

Method: 提出了DAIF方法，包括频率过滤和跨变量修补两种策略，专门针对倒置框架设计。

Result: 实验证明DAIF在多个数据集和倒置模型上均有效。

Conclusion: DAIF成功解决了iTransformer倒置框架的局限性，提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Currently, iTransformer is one of the most popular and effective models for
multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Thanks to its inverted framework,
iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the
inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal
interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant
variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data
augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data
augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation
specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first
define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then
propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation
Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework.
Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our DAIF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LRMR的两阶段LLM框架，用于提高直肠癌淋巴结转移的诊断性能，通过结构化报告和多节点排名实现更高的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI评估直肠癌淋巴结转移的诊断性能有限，现有AI模型缺乏可解释性且忽略患者层面的上下文。

Method: LRMR框架分为两阶段：1) 多模态LLM生成淋巴结的详细结构化报告；2) 文本LLM通过比较不同患者的报告进行相对风险排名。

Result: 在117名患者的回顾性队列中，LRMR的AUC为0.7917，F1-score为0.7200，优于ResNet50等基线模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段LLM框架通过分离视觉感知和认知推理，为直肠癌淋巴结转移评估提供了高效、可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal
cancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on
morphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some
artificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black
boxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these
models typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level
context. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven
Relational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic
task from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and
ranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal
large language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a
patient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological
features. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these
reports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based
on the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a
retrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of
deep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies
confirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational
ranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant
performance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our
work demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning
through a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and
effective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.

Motivation: 物联网设备收集的时间序列数据具有非线性和非平稳性，传统集中式分析存在延迟和通信成本问题，联邦学习提供了一种分布式解决方案。

Result: 联邦学习在非线性数据分布下表现较差，但去趋势技术能显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在处理复杂时间序列数据时需结合去趋势技术以提高预测准确性。

Abstract: With advancements in computing and communication technologies, the Internet
of Things (IoT) has seen significant growth. IoT devices typically collect data
from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of
this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is
centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased
communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective
alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the
need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and
environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different
locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.
Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is
crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather
forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction
accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how
non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized
extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.
(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series
data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated
several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and
trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL
approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world
datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental
results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when
dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate
detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different
data distributions.

Motivation: 传统纤维追踪方法存在局限性，RL框架在追踪性能上表现更优，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 扩展TractOracle-RL框架，引入Iterative Reward Training (IRT)训练方案，利用束过滤方法迭代优化奖励机制。

Result: 结合RL框架和oracle反馈的方法在多种数据集上表现稳健，显著优于传统技术。

Conclusion: RL结合oracle反馈的方法为纤维追踪提供了更可靠和准确的解决方案，IRT进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Tractography algorithms leverage diffusion MRI to reconstruct the fibrous
architecture of the brain's white matter. Among machine learning approaches,
reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
tractography, outperforming traditional methods in several key aspects.
TractOracle-RL, a recent RL-based approach, reduces false positives by
incorporating anatomical priors into the training process via a reward-based
mechanism. In this paper, we investigate four extensions of the original
TractOracle-RL framework by integrating recent advances in RL, and we evaluate
their performance across five diverse diffusion MRI datasets. Results
demonstrate that combining an oracle with the RL framework consistently leads
to robust and reliable tractography, regardless of the specific method or
dataset used. We also introduce a novel RL training scheme called Iterative
Reward Training (IRT), inspired by the Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) paradigm. Instead of relying on human input, IRT leverages
bundle filtering methods to iteratively refine the oracle's guidance throughout
training. Experimental results show that RL methods trained with oracle
feedback significantly outperform widely used tractography techniques in terms
of accuracy and anatomical validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统激活函数（如ReLU、sigmoid和tanh）存在局限性，Wendland RBF因其紧支撑、光滑性和正定性在逼近理论中表现优异，因此被引入以改进深度学习的性能。

Method: 提出增强型Wendland激活函数，结合标准Wendland分量与线性及指数项，理论分析其数学特性，并通过合成任务（如正弦波逼近）和基准数据集（MNIST、Fashion-MNIST）进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，Wendland激活函数在回归任务中表现优异，同时保持计算效率，能够缓解过拟合并提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究将经典RBF理论与现代深度学习结合，表明Wendland激活函数具有潜力，未来可探索混合架构和领域特定适配。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel parametric activation function based on
Wendland radial basis functions (RBFs) for deep neural networks. Wendland RBFs,
known for their compact support, smoothness, and positive definiteness in
approximation theory, are adapted to address limitations of traditional
activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. The proposed enhanced
Wendland activation combines a standard Wendland component with linear and
exponential terms, offering tunable locality, improved gradient propagation,
and enhanced stability during training. Theoretical analysis highlights its
mathematical properties, including smoothness and adaptability, while empirical
experiments on synthetic tasks (e.g., sine wave approximation) and benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate competitive performance. Results
show that the Wendland-based activation achieves superior accuracy in certain
scenarios, particularly in regression tasks, while maintaining computational
efficiency. The study bridges classical RBF theory with modern deep learning,
suggesting that Wendland activations can mitigate overfitting and improve
generalization through localized, smooth transformations. Future directions
include hybrid architectures and domain-specific adaptations.

Result: 在合成数据和NLB基准测试中表现优于现有方法，准确匹配真实放电率并提升预测和解码性能。

Conclusion: LangevinFlow提供了一个灵活且高性能的框架，用于建模复杂神经动态及其未观测影响。

Abstract: Neural populations exhibit latent dynamical structures that drive
time-evolving spiking activities, motivating the search for models that capture
both intrinsic network dynamics and external unobserved influences. In this
work, we introduce LangevinFlow, a sequential Variational Auto-Encoder where
the time evolution of latent variables is governed by the underdamped Langevin
equation. Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,
damping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent
both autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the
potential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled
oscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors
observed in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent
encoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent
space. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
synthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching
ground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model
achieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward
prediction accuracy across four challenging datasets. It also matches or
surpasses alternative methods in decoding behavioral metrics such as hand
velocity. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, physics-inspired,
high-performing framework for modeling complex neural population dynamics and
their unobserved influences.

App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for
mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and
Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur
on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned
the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of
14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we
demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically,
maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's
mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard
commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our
fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device
deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for
future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental
health solutions.

### [122] [Transforming Sensitive Documents into Quantitative Data: An AI-Based Preprocessing Toolchain for Structured and Privacy-Conscious Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10582)
*Anders Ledberg,Anna Thalén*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化工具链，用于处理非结构化文本数据，支持隐私敏感的大规模研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律、医疗和行政领域的非结构化文本是公共卫生和社会科学研究的宝贵资源，但敏感信息和结构异质性阻碍了大规模分析。

Method: 使用开源模型构建工具链，通过LLM提示标准化、总结和翻译文本，结合命名实体识别和规则方法匿名化。

Result: 在瑞典法院案例中验证了工具链的有效性，成功匿名化并保留语义内容，支持半自动化内容分析。

Conclusion: 该工具链为隐私敏感领域的大规模文本分析提供了新可能。

Abstract: Unstructured text from legal, medical, and administrative sources offers a
rich but underutilized resource for research in public health and the social
sciences. However, large-scale analysis is hampered by two key challenges: the
presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information, and significant
heterogeneity in structure and language. We present a modular toolchain that
prepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on
open-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a
workstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.
  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,
summarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater
comparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented
with named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of
disclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court
decisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.
Each document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and
transformed into a document-level embedding. Validation, including manual
review, automated scanning, and predictive evaluation shows the toolchain
effectively removes identifying information while retaining semantic content.
As an illustrative application, we train a predictive model using embedding
vectors derived from a small set of manually labeled summaries, demonstrating
the toolchain's capacity for semi-automated content analysis at scale.
  By enabling structured, privacy-conscious analysis of sensitive documents,
our toolchain opens new possibilities for large-scale research in domains where
textual data was previously inaccessible due to privacy and heterogeneity
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的兴起，需要结构化方法来验证AI行为，NLEs成为关键。

Method: 基于XAI文献，构建了针对NLEs的三维分类法：上下文、生成与呈现、评估。

Result: 分类法为研究者、审计者和政策制定者提供了设计和改进NLEs的框架。

Conclusion: 该分类法有助于提升AI系统的透明度和治理效果。

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to
access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models,
Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model
behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and
governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create
an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions:
(1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and
Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and
forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered
properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a
framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design,
and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（事实不准确），影响实际部署中的可信度。

Method: 结合自动提示重写、混合检索和低秩适配器调优，通过幻觉检测模块和反馈修正循环增强事实对齐。

Result: AutoRAG-LoRA显著减少了事实漂移，同时保持了模型的效率和模块化。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了生成内容的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a
range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations -
factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present
AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that
tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based
adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt
rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in
retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both
classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to
generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop
enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We
demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while
preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过语言模型表达不确定性以提高用户信任，提出了模仿人类沟通的“拟人化不确定性”概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型输出常过于自信，影响用户信任，需通过语言表达不确定性以优化人机协作。

Method: 综述人类不确定性沟通研究，分析数据偏见，提出拟人化不确定性概念。

Result: 揭示了语言模型中不确定性表达的偏见，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 拟人化不确定性是提高语言模型信任的关键，需进一步研究其实现方法。

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large
language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and
problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is
undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident
terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to
signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the
benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms.
Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means,
an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces.
Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP)
overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data
biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for
anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty
communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization
to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We
present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty
communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to
demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by
pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and
deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for
NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLEX是一种无需扰动的局部解释方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，显著提高了解释效率，与LIME和SHAP效果相当但计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文本分类中表现优异，但其复杂性导致解释性差，现有XAI方法（如LIME和SHAP）计算成本高。

Method: 提出PLEX方法，利用LLM的上下文嵌入和Siamese网络，避免后续扰动，实现高效解释。

Result: 在四个分类任务中，PLEX与LIME和SHAP的一致性超过92%，且计算效率提升显著。

Conclusion: PLEX为LLM的文本分类提供了一种高效且可靠的解释方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their
complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the
reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and
SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely
on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate
thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a
substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we
propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation
(PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from
the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with
feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for
subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.
We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks
(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than
92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test"
reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar
decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these
words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior
performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically
accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and
four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution
for explainable LLM-based text classification.

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何建模用户情感状态，以促进其伦理部署。

Method: 基于情感轮（心理学框架）分析模型输出中情感状态的概率依赖关系。

Result: LLMs形成分层情感树，与人类心理模型一致；模型规模越大，层次越复杂。同时发现情感识别中的系统性偏见，尤其是对少数群体的误分类。

Conclusion: LLMs内化了社会感知的某些方面，研究结果提示了基于认知理论的模型评估潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,
understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical
deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues
emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies
between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form
hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and
larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic
biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding
misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies
reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social
perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our
results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for
developing better model evaluations.

Motivation: 成人服务网站（ASW）广告数据被用于识别性交易受害者，但其文本分析面临挑战（如表情符号、语法混乱和故意混淆），需要更有效的语言建模方法。

Method: 研究了多种语言建模方法，包括信息检索、预训练Transformer和定制Transformer模型，并针对ASW文本特征优化了模型。

Result: 定制Transformer模型在准确性、召回率、F1分数和ROC AUC上优于BERT-base、RoBERTa和ModernBERT等模型，并成功应用于ASW数据分析任务。

Conclusion: 定制Transformer模型在ASW文本分析中表现优异，为下游应用和研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Sex trafficking refers to the use of force, fraud, or coercion to compel an
individual to perform in commercial sex acts against their will. Adult service
websites (ASWs) have and continue to be linked to sex trafficking, offering a
platform for traffickers to advertise their victims. Thus, organizations
involved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when
attempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge
in transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous
research using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking
ads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of
emojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement
scrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for
this application area, including simple information retrieval methods,
pre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that
characteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to
be trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for
inference on consumer hardware. Our custom models outperform fine-tuned
variants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,
RoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We
demonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks
related to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph
representation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the
learned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context
we study. The models we develop represent a significant advancement in ASW text
analysis, which can be leveraged in a variety of downstream applications and
research.

performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis
of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis
further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key
insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，社交平台上的仇恨言论并未因获得社会认可（如点赞）而显著增加或极端化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交认可理论是否适用于解释在线仇恨言论的动机。

Method: 分析了2018-2021年间Parler平台上的1.1亿条帖子，检验点赞与后续仇恨言论的关系。

Result: 点赞数与后续仇恨言论无显著关联，甚至在某些情况下呈负相关。

Conclusion: 社交认可机制在特定平台上的作用可能与理论预期不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social
approval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's
(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social
approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as
social approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over
110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of
upvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the
amount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,
three months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average
negative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the
post level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social
approval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on
niche social media platforms.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在司法系统中的公平性，以确保其决策的可信度和社会公正。

Method: 构建了一个包含65个标签和161个值的评估框架，开发了三种评估指标（不一致性、偏见和不平衡不准确性），并对16种LLMs进行了实验。

Result: 实验发现LLMs普遍存在不一致性、偏见和不平衡不准确性，尤其在人口统计标签上偏见更明显。调整温度参数可影响公平性，但模型大小、发布时间和来源国无显著影响。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个公开可用的工具包，支持未来研究和改进LLM公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields
where their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial
fairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs
act as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite
to ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we
construct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a
selection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to
the judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising
177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop
three evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and
introduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across
various labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive
inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring
severe LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more
pronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance
labels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency
correlates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate
biases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence
LLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit
significant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly
available toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future
research in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.

Motivation: 研究用户与系统风格相似性对用户印象的影响，区分主观与客观相似性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建包含用户偏好、主观风格相似性和客观风格相似性的新数据集，并在开放域对话环境中进行分析。

Result: 主观风格相似性与用户偏好呈强正相关，且与第三方标注的客观相似性存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 强调区分主观与客观评价的重要性，为对话系统的风格设计提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dialogue generation have broadened the scope of
human-bot interactions, enabling not only contextually appropriate responses
but also the analysis of human affect and sensitivity. While prior work has
suggested that stylistic similarity between user and system may enhance user
impressions, the distinction between subjective and objective similarity is
often overlooked. To investigate this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that
includes users' preferences, subjective stylistic similarity based on users'
own perceptions, and objective stylistic similarity annotated by third party
evaluators in open-domain dialogue settings. Analysis using the constructed
dataset reveals a strong positive correlation between subjective stylistic
similarity and user preference. Furthermore, our analysis suggests an important
finding: users' subjective stylistic similarity differs from third party
objective similarity. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
subjective and objective evaluations and understanding the distinct aspects
each captures when analyzing the relationship between stylistic similarity and
user preferences. The dataset presented in this paper is available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决韩语中同音异义汉字词在韩文书写中难以区分的问题，提升低资源语言模型的性能。

Method: 采用HanjaBridge技术，在持续预训练框架中为同音词提供所有可能的汉字候选，结合知识蒸馏避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在KoBALT基准上相对提升21%，并观察到中韩跨语言迁移的积极效果。

Conclusion: HanjaBridge有效提升韩语理解能力，且无需推理时额外成本，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource
languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as
homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To
address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel
meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)
framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja
(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja
candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual
disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation
to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge
significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative
improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment
between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive
cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja
augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with
no additional run-time cost.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLM类比推理能力的理解，为其作为人类推理模型的潜力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer
to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models
align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research
has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack
robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the
current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a
fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human
performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in
LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity
between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity
between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the
effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we
examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in
humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and
not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our
experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)
and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as
GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical
reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

large language-models (LLMs), we adopted a prompt-engineering strategy in which
diverse LLMs conducted BDI-II-based assessments and produced structured JSON

agreement and internal consistency. Our prompt design methodology aligned model
outputs with BDI-II criteria and enabled the analysis of conversational cues
that influenced the prediction of symptoms. Our best submission, second on the
official leaderboard, achieved DCHR = 0.50, ADODL = 0.89, and ASHR = 0.27.

Motivation: 手语生成因复杂性和独特规则而受限，研究旨在利用LLM的推理能力和丰富知识解决这一问题。

Method: 通过微调LLM，采用逐步提示策略学习文本与手语的对应关系，支持生成过程。

Result: 在How2Sign和Phoenix14T数据集上，方法有效结合LLM的手语知识和推理能力，对齐手语与口语的分布和语法规则。

Conclusion: TEAM-Sign成功利用LLM处理手语生成，为手语与口语的差异提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models, with their strong reasoning ability and rich
knowledge, have brought revolution to many tasks of AI, but their impact on
sign language generation remains limited due to its complexity and unique
rules. In this paper, we propose TEAch Me Sign (TEAM-Sign), treating sign
language as another natural language. By fine-tuning an LLM, we enable it to
learn the correspondence between text and sign language, and facilitate
generation. Considering the differences between sign and spoken language, we
employ a stepwise prompting strategy to extract the inherent sign language
knowledge within the LLM, thereby supporting the learning and generation
process. Experimental results on How2Sign and Phoenix14T datasets demonstrate
that our approach effectively leverages both the sign language knowledge and
reasoning capabilities of LLM to align the different distribution and
grammatical rules between sign and spoken language.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LoRA的分层适配方法，用于检测英语和西班牙语推文中的性别歧视，通过多语言训练和参数高效微调，显著提升了性能并减少了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本性别歧视检测任务，特别是在多语言环境下，同时减少计算和存储资源的需求。

Method: 采用分层LoRA适配器，显式建模标签依赖关系，并对所有线性变换进行适配，结合多语言训练策略。

Result: 在多任务中表现优异（F1分数：0.6774、0.4991、0.6519），训练时间和存储需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 分层LoRA和多语言训练策略在性别歧视检测中高效且有效，适合资源受限的场景。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to EXIST 2025 Task 1, addressing text-based
sexism detection in English and Spanish tweets through hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) of Llama 3.1 8B. Our method introduces conditional adapter
routing that explicitly models label dependencies across three hierarchically
structured subtasks: binary sexism identification, source intention detection,
and multilabel sexism categorization. Unlike conventional LoRA applications
that target only attention layers, we apply adaptation to all linear
transformations, enhancing the model's capacity to capture task-specific
patterns. In contrast to complex data processing and ensemble approaches, we
show that straightforward parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves strong
performance. We train separate LoRA adapters (rank=16, QLoRA 4-bit) for each
subtask using unified multilingual training that leverages Llama 3.1's native
bilingual capabilities. The method requires minimal preprocessing and uses
standard supervised learning. Our multilingual training strategy eliminates the
need for separate language-specific models, achieving 1.7-2.4\% F1 improvements
through cross-lingual transfer. With only 1.67\% trainable parameters compared
to full fine-tuning, our approach reduces training time by 75\% and model
storage by 98\%, while achieving competitive performance across all subtasks
(ICM-Hard: 0.6774 for binary classification, 0.4991 for intention detection,
0.6519 for multilabel categorization).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻消费增长导致个性化推荐系统可能加剧信息茧房和政治极化，需要立场检测技术来促进观点多样性和媒体偏见分析。

Method: 提出K-News-Stance数据集和JoA-ICL框架，后者通过语言模型代理检测关键段落立场并聚合推断全文立场。

Result: JoA-ICL在立场检测上优于现有方法，案例研究显示其在新闻推荐和媒体偏见分析中的实用性。

Conclusion: K-News-Stance和JoA-ICL为长文本立场检测提供了有效工具，有助于促进新闻多样性和减少偏见。

Abstract: As online news consumption grows, personalized recommendation systems have
become integral to digital journalism. However, these systems risk reinforcing
filter bubbles and political polarization by failing to incorporate diverse
perspectives. Stance detection -- identifying a text's position on a target --
can help mitigate this by enabling viewpoint-aware recommendations and
data-driven analyses of media bias. Yet, existing stance detection research
remains largely limited to short texts and high-resource languages. To address
these gaps, we introduce \textsc{K-News-Stance}, the first Korean dataset for
article-level stance detection, comprising 2,000 news articles with
article-level and 19,650 segment-level stance annotations across 47 societal
issues. We also propose \textsc{JoA-ICL}, a \textbf{Jo}urnalism-guided
\textbf{A}gentic \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{L}earning framework that
employs a language model agent to predict the stances of key structural
segments (e.g., leads, quotes), which are then aggregated to infer the overall
article stance. Experiments show that \textsc{JoA-ICL} outperforms existing
stance detection methods, highlighting the benefits of segment-level agency in
capturing the overall position of long-form news articles. Two case studies
further demonstrate its broader utility in promoting viewpoint diversity in
news recommendations and uncovering patterns of media bias.

Motivation: 现有心血管疾病预测模型主要依赖结构化数据，但非结构化临床笔记中包含有价值的早期指标，需要更有效的方法进行提取和分析。

Method: 采用领域适应的大语言模型进行症状提取、上下文推理和相关性分析，结合心血管特异性微调、基于提示的推理和实体感知推理。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和CARDIO-NLP数据集上表现优异，精度、召回率、F1分数和AUROC均有提升，临床相关性高（kappa = 0.82）。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在临床决策支持系统中的潜力，可提升早期预警系统，并将患者叙述转化为可操作的风险评估。

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing
prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical
notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel
LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language
models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from
free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning,
prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III
and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by
cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when
plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity,
which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events
are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This
work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems
(CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of
patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习技术分析低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中的社交媒体情绪，以理解公众在历史性事件（如七月革命）中的情感表达。

Method: 采用混合Transformer框架（包括BanglaBERT、mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa和提出的XMB-BERT），结合PCA降维和11种机器学习分类器进行情感分析。

Result: 提出的XMB-BERT与投票分类器组合达到了83.7%的准确率，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明机器学习技术可以有效分析低资源语言中的社交媒体情绪，为类似研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The July Revolution in Bangladesh marked a significant student-led mass
uprising, uniting people across the nation to demand justice, accountability,
and systemic reform. Social media platforms played a pivotal role in amplifying
public sentiment and shaping discourse during this historic mass uprising. In
this study, we present a hybrid transformer-based sentiment analysis framework
to decode public opinion expressed in social media comments during and after
the revolution. We used a brand new dataset of 4,200 Bangla comments collected
from social media. The framework employs advanced transformer-based feature
extraction techniques, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and the
proposed hybrid XMB-BERT, to capture nuanced patterns in textual data.
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were utilized for dimensionality reduction
to enhance computational efficiency. We explored eleven traditional and
advanced machine learning classifiers for identifying sentiments. The proposed
hybrid XMB-BERT with the voting classifier achieved an exceptional accuracy of
83.7% and outperform other model classifier combinations. This study
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques to analyze social
sentiment in low-resource languages like Bangla.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在跨境金融活动中使用大语言模型（LLMs）进行实体匹配的优越性，相比传统方法，LLMs在准确性和减少误报方面表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨境金融活动的增加使得准确识别和分类外国实体变得至关重要，传统匹配方法因语言和语义问题效果不佳。

Method: 研究比较了传统匹配算法（如Jaccard、余弦、Levenshtein距离）、基于Hugging Face的LLMs和接口型LLMs（如Microsoft Copilot、阿里巴巴的Qwen 2.5），使用65个葡萄牙公司案例数据集。

Result: 传统方法准确率超92%但误报率高（20-40%），接口型LLMs准确率超93%，F1分数超96%，误报率更低（40-80%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在实体匹配任务中表现优于传统方法，尤其在处理语言和语义复杂性时更具优势。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of cross-border financial activities in global markets
has underscored the necessity of accurately identifying and classifying foreign
entities. This practice is essential within the Spanish financial system for
ensuring robust risk management, regulatory adherence, and the prevention of
financial misconduct. This process involves a labor-intensive entity-matching
task, where entities need to be validated against available reference sources.
Challenges arise from linguistic variations, special characters, outdated
names, and changes in legal forms, complicating traditional matching algorithms
like Jaccard, cosine, and Levenshtein distances. These methods struggle with
contextual nuances and semantic relationships, leading to mismatches. To
address these limitations, we explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
flexible alternative. LLMs leverage extensive training to interpret context,
handle abbreviations, and adapt to legal transitions. We evaluate traditional
methods, Hugging Face-based LLMs, and interface-based LLMs (e.g., Microsoft
Copilot, Alibaba's Qwen 2.5) using a dataset of 65 Portuguese company cases.
Results show traditional methods achieve accuracies over 92% but suffer high
false positive rates (20-40%). Interface-based LLMs outperform, achieving
accuracies above 93%, F1 scores exceeding 96%, and lower false positives
(40-80%).

Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型（dLLMs）在推理速度和交互性上优于自回归模型，但其安全对齐机制存在漏洞，易受上下文感知的对抗性提示攻击。

Method: 提出DIJA框架，利用dLLMs的双向建模和平行解码特性，构造对抗性掩码文本提示，绕过安全对齐机制。

Result: DIJA在多个评测中显著优于现有攻击方法，最高可达100%关键词攻击成功率，暴露了dLLMs的安全威胁。

Conclusion: 研究强调了重新设计dLLMs安全对齐机制的紧迫性，以避免潜在的有害内容生成风险。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and
greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.
However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we
identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to
safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,
exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first
systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety
weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial
interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of
dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional
modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked
spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic
filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard
alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned
dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed
in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA
significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously
overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves
up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior
baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and
by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of
harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent
need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

Method: 提出一个框架研究LLMs中的中毒问题，展示多触发器共存现象，并设计了一种选择性重训练特定模型组件的后恢复方法。

Result: 实验表明，多触发器可以同时嵌入模型且保持鲁棒激活，后恢复方法能高效移除触发行为。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了LLMs更广泛和持久的漏洞，并提出了一种实用的防御方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
data poisoning attacks, where malicious training examples embed hidden
behaviours triggered by specific input patterns. However, most existing works
assume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited
understanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within
the model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in
LLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a
single model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed
several triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding
similarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation
even when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings
expose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate
this threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains
specific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis. Our
method effectively removes the trigger behaviour with minimal parameter
updates, presenting a practical and efficient defence against multi-trigger
poisoning.

Abstract: We present a robust ensemble-based system for multilingual multimodal
reasoning, designed for the ImageCLEF 2025 EXAMS V challenge. Our approach
integrates Gemini 2.5 Flash for visual description, Gemini 1.5 Pro for caption
refinement and consistency checks, and Gemini 2.5 Pro as a reasoner which
handles final answer selection, all coordinated through carefully engineered
few-shot and zero-shot prompts. We conducted an extensive ablation study,
training several large language models (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Phi 4, Gemma 3,
Mistral) on an English dataset and its multilingual augmented version.
Additionally, we evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash in a zero-shot setting for
comparison and found it to substantially outperform the trained models. Prompt
design also proved critical: enforcing concise, language-normalized formats and
prohibiting explanatory text boosted model accuracy on the English validation
set from 55.9% to 61.7%. On the official leaderboard, our system (Team MSA)
achieved first place overall in the multilingual track with 81.4% accuracy, and
led 11 out of 13 individual language tracks, with top results such as 95.07%
for Croatian and 92.12% for Italian. These findings highlight that lightweight
OCR-VLM ensembles, when paired with precise prompt strategies and cross-lingual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs可能记忆并泄露个人信息的问题，特别是如何识别模型存储的个体-事实关联，以符合GDPR中的RTBF要求。

Method: 方法包括引入WikiMem数据集（包含5000多个自然语言提示）和模型无关的指标，通过校准负对数似然对真实值与反事实进行排序。

Result: 实验评估了15个LLMs（参数规模从410M到70B），发现记忆程度与个体网络存在和模型规模相关。

Conclusion: 研究为在个体层面识别LLMs中记忆的个人数据提供了基础，支持动态构建遗忘集以满足机器遗忘和RTBF需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and reveal personal information,
raising concerns regarding compliance with the EU's GDPR, particularly the
Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF). Existing machine unlearning methods assume the
data to forget is already known but do not address how to identify which
individual-fact associations are stored in the model. Privacy auditing
techniques typically operate at the population level or target a small set of
identifiers, limiting applicability to individual-level data inquiries. We
introduce WikiMem, a dataset of over 5,000 natural language canaries covering
243 human-related properties from Wikidata, and a model-agnostic metric to
quantify human-fact associations in LLMs. Our approach ranks ground-truth
values against counterfactuals using calibrated negative log-likelihood across
paraphrased prompts. We evaluate 200 individuals across 15 LLMs (410M-70B
parameters), showing that memorization correlates with subject web presence and
model scale. We provide a foundation for identifying memorized personal data in
LLMs at the individual level, enabling the dynamic construction of forget sets
for machine unlearning and RTBF requests.

Motivation: 探索多代理系统（MAS）在定性研究中的潜力，特别是其在编码和数据标注方面的表现，以弥补现有研究中对其优势理解的不足。

Method: 通过实验研究，使用六种开源LLM（参数规模从30亿到320亿不等）和18种实验配置，分析了77,000多个编码决策，并与人类标注的数学辅导会话转录本进行对比。

Result: 温度和代理角色显著影响共识构建，但MAS在编码准确性上并未普遍优于单代理。仅在某些特定条件下（如低温和包含至少一个自信角色），MAS表现优于单代理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于LLM的定性方法的局限性，挑战了多样MAS角色能带来更好结果的观念，并开源了MAS和实验代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative
research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent
systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over
single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental
study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding
accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source
MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and
consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion
parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding
decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from
online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and
when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas
(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus
in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,
higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas
on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust
improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS
consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code
category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was
0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive
persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations
suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications
that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight
into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that
diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and
experimentation code.

Motivation: 现有资源主要针对英语和美国社会背景，缺乏对其他语言和社会背景的偏见评估工具。

Method: 基于BBQ数据集，设计了西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的平行数据集，采用多选题QA设置评估10类社会偏见。

Result: LLMs在模糊场景中倾向于选择错误答案，高QA准确率常与更强的偏见依赖相关。

Conclusion: 需要更多针对非英语语言和社会背景的偏见评估工具，以更全面地评估LLMs的社会偏见。

Abstract: Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs)
perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable
lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English,
and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the
Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and
CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to
assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now
adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of
Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model
family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose
the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often
correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

Result: 在FTP和RTSP协议上的实验表明，FlowFSM提取精度高，且减少了虚假状态转换。

Conclusion: FlowFSM展示了基于代理的LLM系统在协议分析和FSM推断中的潜力。

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic
of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability
discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as
scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language
specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework
that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and
chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents.
FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state
transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs.
Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM
achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions,
showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based
LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for
cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM的多语言机制具有挑战性，现有研究难以从跨语言表征中分离语言特定单元。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器（SAE）和特征激活概率方法（SAE-LAPE）识别语言特定特征。

Result: 发现语言特定特征主要分布在模型的中后层，且可解释性强，可用于语言识别，性能与fastText相当。

Conclusion: SAE-LAPE方法有效识别了语言特定特征，为理解LLM的多语言机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the multilingual mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
provides insight into how they process different languages, yet this remains
challenging. Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their
polysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from
cross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete
and abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features
are language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature
activation probability, to identify language-specific features within the
feed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in
the middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features
influence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be
used for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along
with more interpretability. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KV-Latent通过降采样Key-Value向量维度到潜在空间，显著减少KV Cache占用并提升推理速度，仅需少量额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoder架构的Key-Value缓存逐渐增加成为推理效率瓶颈，影响内存消耗和数据传输带宽。

Method: 提出KV-Latent范式，降采样Key-Value向量维度，改进Rotary Positional Embedding的频率采样机制以增强稳定性。

Result: 实验显示KV-Latent在减少缓存和提高推理速度方面效果显著，且对模型性能影响较小。

Conclusion: KV-Latent为高效语言模型系统提供了新可能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer Decoders have become the
preferred choice for conversational generative AI. Despite the overall
superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,
both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By
down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can
significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only
with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes.
Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on
lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,
avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position
attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query
Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we
conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing
Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the
construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new
possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at

Abstract: Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale
datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct
formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning.
In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language
models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free
formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level
dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The
dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$

making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally,
we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and
empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing
sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three
automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its
challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究为中文仇恨言论检测的可解释性提供了重要资源和见解。

Abstract: The proliferation of hate speech has inflicted significant societal harm,
with its intensity and directionality closely tied to specific targets and
arguments. In recent years, numerous machine learning-based methods have been
developed to detect hateful comments on online platforms automatically.
However, research on Chinese hate speech detection lags behind, and
interpretability studies face two major challenges: first, the scarcity of
span-level fine-grained annotated datasets limits models' deep semantic
understanding of hate speech; second, insufficient research on identifying and
interpreting coded hate speech restricts model explainability in complex
real-world scenarios. To address these, we make the following contributions:
(1) We introduce the Span-level Target-Aware Toxicity Extraction dataset (STATE
ToxiCN), the first span-level Chinese hate speech dataset, and evaluate the
hate semantic understanding of existing models using it. (2) We conduct the
first comprehensive study on Chinese coded hate terms, LLMs' ability to
interpret hate semantics. (3) We propose a method to integrate an annotated
lexicon into models, significantly enhancing hate speech detection performance.
Our work provides valuable resources and insights to advance the
interpretability of Chinese hate speech detection research.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted
increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability
to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value
Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of
LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and
modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an
accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value
vector identification method. To consistently control values without
sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation
method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that
our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values
without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even
with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are

<details>

Motivation: 传统新颖性评估方法（专家判断或引用组合）存在局限性，如专家知识有限和引用组合效果不确定。结合LLM的知识和人类专家的判断能力可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 从同行评审报告中提取新颖性相关句子，用LLM总结论文方法部分，用于微调PLMs；设计了基于Sparse-Attention的文本引导融合模块，整合人类和LLM知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在评估方法新颖性方面优于大量基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合人类和LLM知识的方法能有效评估学术论文的方法新颖性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating
academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique
reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited
knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain.
Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large
language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts
possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our
research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to
address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in
academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose
leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs,
e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we
extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review
reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper,
which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a
text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human
and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of
baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的PMRs在结构、复杂性和可用性上差异较大，且缺乏系统比较，同时PMG方法的评估策略和生成技术各异，难以直接对比。

Method: 研究引入了一个包含55个流程描述和九种不同PMRs模型的新数据集PMo Dataset，并从两个维度评估PMRs：LLM-based PMo的适用性和PMG性能。

Result: Mermaid在六项PMo标准中得分最高，而BPMN text在流程元素相似性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为PMRs的选择提供了实证依据，Mermaid和BPMN text在不同场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied for Process Modeling
(PMo) tasks such as Process Model Generation (PMG). To support these tasks,
researchers have introduced a variety of Process Model Representations (PMRs)
that serve as model abstractions or generation targets. However, these PMRs
differ widely in structure, complexity, and usability, and have never been
systematically compared. Moreover, recent PMG approaches rely on distinct
evaluation strategies and generation techniques, making comparison difficult.
This paper presents the first empirical study that evaluates multiple PMRs in
the context of PMo with LLMs. We introduce the PMo Dataset, a new dataset
containing 55 process descriptions paired with models in nine different PMRs.
We evaluate PMRs along two dimensions: suitability for LLM-based PMo and
performance on PMG. \textit{Mermaid} achieves the highest overall score across
six PMo criteria, whereas \textit{BPMN text} delivers the best PMG results in
terms of process element similarity.

Result: 加权损失函数提高了高频情感类的性能，但对少数类影响有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在多标签情感检测中有效，但仍面临处理少数类的挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of a simple weighted loss function to
Transformer-based models for multi-label emotion detection in SemEval-2025
Shared Task 11. Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting
class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes
without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate
BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such
as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients.
The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on
high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes.
These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying
this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速发展，评估数据污染（BDC）问题日益突出，导致性能指标虚高，影响对模型泛化能力的真实评估。

Method: DCR框架通过四个粒度级别（语义、信息、数据和标签）检测污染，并使用模糊推理系统合成污染分数，生成统一的DCR因子来调整原始准确率。

Result: 在9个LLMs（0.5B-72B）上的验证表明，DCR能可靠诊断污染严重程度，调整后的准确率与未污染基准相比平均误差在4%以内。

Conclusion: DCR框架计算高效且透明，为常规评估提供了实用的污染检测工具，有助于更公平的比较和提升LLM基准测试的可信度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize
evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine
generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk
(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and
quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and
label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR
produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect
contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across
sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the
DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy
adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three
benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational
efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating
contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons
and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

Conclusion: KisMATH支持受控的图对齐干预，为深入研究CoT在LLM推理中的作用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large
language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on
the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more
light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed
acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model
fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of
$1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their
associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed
empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in
the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for
reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating
that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables
controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further
investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Method: 使用相同的训练方法构建编码器和解码器模型（参数从1700万到10亿），训练数据达2万亿token，并进行任务适应实验。

Result: 编码器在分类和检索任务中优于解码器，解码器在生成任务中表现更好；任务适应训练效果不佳。

Conclusion: 编码器和解码器各有优势，任务适应训练效果有限，开源数据促进未来研究。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) community focuses almost exclusively on
decoder-only language models, since they are easier to use for text generation.
However, a large subset of the community still uses encoder-only models for
tasks such as classification or retrieval. Previous work has attempted to
compare these architectures, but is forced to make comparisons with models that
have different numbers of parameters, training techniques, and datasets. We
introduce the SOTA open-data Ettin suite of models: paired encoder-only and
decoder-only models ranging from 17 million parameters to 1 billion, trained on
up to 2 trillion tokens. Using the same recipe for both encoder-only and
decoder-only models produces SOTA recipes in both categories for their
respective sizes, beating ModernBERT as an encoder and Llama 3.2 and SmolLM2 as
decoders. Like previous work, we find that encoder-only models excel at
classification and retrieval tasks while decoders excel at generative tasks.
However, we show that adapting a decoder model to encoder tasks (and vice
versa) through continued training is subpar compared to using only the reverse
objective (i.e. a 400M encoder outperforms a 1B decoder on MNLI, and vice versa
for generative tasks). We open-source all artifacts of this study including
training data, training order segmented by checkpoint, and 200+ checkpoints to
allow future work to analyze or extend all aspects of training.

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLMs推理能力提供了新方向，强调自适应策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Human reasoning involves different strategies, each suited to specific
problems. Prior work shows that large language model (LLMs) tend to favor a
single reasoning strategy, potentially limiting their effectiveness in diverse
reasoning challenges. In this work, we investigate whether prompting can
control LLMs reasoning strategies and assess its impact on logical
problem-solving. While our experiments show that no single strategy
consistently improves accuracy, performance could be enhanced if models could
adaptively choose the optimal strategy. We propose methods to guide LLMs in
strategy selection, highlighting new ways to refine their reasoning abilities.

Result: HKGAI-V1在处理香港特定文化敏感查询上优于通用模型，并开发了对抗性香港价值基准用于评估模型对齐。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是一个技术成果，还为其他地区开发本土化AI系统提供了可复制的蓝图。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of HKGAI-V1, a foundational sovereign
large language model (LLM), developed as part of an initiative to establish
value-aligned AI infrastructure specifically tailored for Hong Kong. Addressing
the region's unique multilingual environment (Cantonese, Mandarin, and
English), its distinct socio-legal context under the "one country, two systems"
framework, and specific local cultural and value considerations, the model is
built upon the DeepSeek architecture and systematically aligned with regional
norms through a multifaceted full parameter fine-tuning process. It is further
integrated with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to ensure timely
and factually grounded information access. The core contribution lies in the
design and implementation of a comprehensive, region-specific AI alignment and
safety framework, demonstrated through two key achievements: 1) The successful
development of HKGAI-V1 itself - which outper-forms general-purpose models in
handling Hong Kong-specific culturally sensitive queries, and embodies a
"governance-embedded" approach to digital sovereignty - empowers Hong Kong to
exercise control over AI applications in critical sectors including public
services, legal systems, and edu-cation. 2) The development of the proprietary
Adversarial HK Value Benchmark, a rigorous tool for evaluating model alignment
with local ethical and legal stand-ards under challenging conditions. By
documenting these achievements, the paper provides not only a technological
artifact but also a replicable blueprint for developing advanced, regionally
focused AI systems deeply rooted in their local identities.

Method: 通过人类评估活动（分类错误评估和跨度级标注），比较传统指标、可训练方法和LLM评判方法。

Result: 简单指标（如词重叠）与人类判断相关性高（Spearman等级相关系数0.63），LLM在评估中表现不可靠。

Conclusion: 简单指标在跨域数据中表现优异，LLM生成摘要质量高但评估不可靠，需注意业务风险和众包评估挑战。

Abstract: We examine evaluation of faithfulness to input data in the context of hotel
highlights: brief LLM-generated summaries that capture unique features of
accommodations. Through human evaluation campaigns involving categorical error
assessment and span-level annotation, we compare traditional metrics, trainable
methods, and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings reveal that simpler
metrics like word overlap correlate surprisingly well with human judgments
(Spearman correlation rank of 0.63), often outperforming more complex methods
when applied to out-of-domain data. We further demonstrate that while LLMs can
generate high-quality highlights, they prove unreliable for evaluation as they
tend to severely under- or over-annotate. Our analysis of real-world business
impacts shows incorrect and non-checkable information pose the greatest risks.
We also highlight challenges in crowdsourced evaluations.

### [167] [CWNet: Causal Wavelet Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10689)
*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Yubing Lu,Mengen Cai,Zijian Zhang,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWNet提出了一种基于小波变换和因果推理的低光图像增强方法，通过全局和局部策略优化语义信息和频率恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低光增强方法忽视实例级语义信息和特征特性，CWNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用因果推理和小波变换，结合全局度量学习和局部CLIP语义损失，优化频率信息恢复。

Result: CWNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CWNet通过因果推理和小波变换有效提升了低光增强性能。

Abstract: Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on
uniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic
information and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address
these limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel
architecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.
Specifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the
concept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective
to reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a
global perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal
embeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal
confounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the
local level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely
maintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present
a wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the
recovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the
specific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across
multiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.

*Jiayuan Chen,Thai-Hoang Pham,Yuanlong Wang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合外部生物知识的新框架，用于增强显微镜图像分析模型，解决细胞系异质性导致的扰动筛选问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于细胞系间的形态和生物学异质性，对新型细胞系的扰动筛选具有挑战性，需要改进现有方法。

Method: 整合外部生物知识（如蛋白质相互作用图和转录组特征）到预训练策略中，明确分离扰动特异性和细胞系特异性表征。

Result: 在RxRx数据库上验证，通过少量样本微调显著提升了模型对新型细胞系的图像分析能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了显微镜图像分析在药物发现中的应用潜力。

Abstract: High-throughput screening techniques, such as microscopy imaging of cellular
responses to genetic and chemical perturbations, play a crucial role in drug
discovery and biomedical research. However, robust perturbation screening for
\textit{de novo} cell lines remains challenging due to the significant
morphological and biological heterogeneity across cell lines. To address this,
we propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into
existing pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.
Our approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell
line-specific representations using external biological information.
Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction
data from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward
perturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate
transcriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell
line-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our
method improves the generalization of imaging models to \textit{de novo} cell
lines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot
fine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from
the RxRx19a dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances
microscopy image profiling for \textit{de novo} cell lines, highlighting its
effectiveness in real-world phenotype-based drug discovery applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现FER数据集存在自发与摆拍图像混杂问题，且模型对非白人或深肤色人群存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FER算法在检测自发表情和不同种族肤色人群时的性能下降和伦理问题。

Method: 审计两个先进FER数据集，提出区分自发与摆拍图像的方法，并测试模型对不同肤色人群的预测偏差。

Result: 数据集存在摆拍图像混杂问题，模型对非白人或深肤色人群更易预测负面情绪。

Conclusion: 数据集和模型需改进以避免在真实应用中造成伤害。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions
into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER
algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions
compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER
algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and
skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices
employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two
state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and
examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a
methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a
significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to
consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between
spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these
datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be
deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of
individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the
datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin
tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people
labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative
emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes
such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需描述符的兴趣点匹配方法，显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖描述符匹配兴趣点，计算和存储开销大。

Method: 在兴趣点检测阶段直接关联匹配点，无需描述符。

Result: 匹配精度略低于传统方法，但内存使用大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何计算机视觉任务提供了一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: The extraction and matching of interest points are fundamental to many
geometric computer vision tasks. Traditionally, matching is performed by
assigning descriptors to interest points and identifying correspondences based
on descriptor similarity. This work introduces a technique where interest
points are inherently associated during detection, eliminating the need for
computing, storing, transmitting, or matching descriptors. Although the
matching accuracy is marginally lower than that of conventional approaches, our
method completely eliminates the need for descriptors, leading to a drastic
reduction in memory usage for localization systems. We assess its effectiveness
by comparing it against both classical handcrafted methods and modern learned
approaches.

Motivation: 航天器在太空环境中易受损，人工或机器人维修成本高，需要可靠且经济的自主检测系统。

Method: 创建了包含64k标注图像的航天器数据集，结合真实与合成背景，并添加噪声和失真。使用YOLOv8和YOLOv11模型进行微调，并在硬件和时间限制下测试性能。

Result: 模型在测试中达到Dice分数0.92，Hausdorff距离0.69，推理时间约0.5秒。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型为航天器实时图像分割提供了有效工具，适用于NASA的检测任务。

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms
of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are
significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human
extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial
operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the
development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While
these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve
satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data
are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated
spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed
on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS
pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image
acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the
images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to
generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and
inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges
for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The
resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of
0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal
Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM
finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we
present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong
and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the
challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse
scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to
conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given

TL;DR: ThinkingViT是一种动态调整计算资源的嵌套ViT架构，通过渐进式推理阶段和Token Recycling机制提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有嵌套Transformer架构对所有输入分配相同计算资源导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 引入ThinkingViT，通过渐进式推理阶段动态调整计算，利用Token Recycling机制优化性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，ThinkingViT在相同吞吐量下准确率提升2.0 p.p.，相同计算量下提升2.9 p.p.。

Conclusion: ThinkingViT显著提升了计算效率，可作为插件升级现有ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformers deliver state-of-the-art performance, yet their fixed
computational budget prevents scalable deployment across heterogeneous
hardware. Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding
nested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,
these models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of
their complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce
ThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages
to dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.
ThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most
important attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient
certainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates
the input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which
conditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous
stage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,
ThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show
that ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points
(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs
on ImageNet-1K. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主目标检测框架（LAOD），实现无需标签的零样本检测，并通过新指标评估定位和命名效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测依赖固定类别集，灵活性不足；现有开放世界和开放词汇检测方法存在语义标签缺失或依赖用户提示的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成场景特定对象名称，结合开放词汇检测器进行定位，动态调整目标。

Result: 在LVIS、COCO和COCO-OOD数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能有效检测和命名新对象。

Conclusion: LAOD框架提升了开放世界理解的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring
costly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD
lacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting
autonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework
that enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed
to an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt
its goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average
Precision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately
evaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD
validate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel
objects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winsor-CAM是一种基于Grad-CAM改进的可视化解释方法，通过跨卷积层聚合信息并应用Winsorization技术，生成更鲁棒和连贯的显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域部署CNN模型时，理解其决策过程至关重要。现有方法如Grad-CAM可能忽略重要语义或放大噪声。

Method: 提出Winsor-CAM，通过Winsorization技术衰减极端值，并允许用户通过阈值调整探索模型行为。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上，Winsor-CAM生成的显著性图更易解释，定位性能优于Grad-CAM和均匀层平均基线。

Conclusion: Winsor-CAM通过提供可解释的多层洞察和人工控制，推动了可信AI的发展。

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method
for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional
layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure
important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a
novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent
saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To
mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM
applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A
user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible
exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations
on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable
heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including
intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM
and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of
trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with
human-in-the-loop control.

Result: 在图像编辑和文本到图像概念定制任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏编码框架提高了模型的可解释性和任务适应性，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence
across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for
adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from
scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations
are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging
to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new
tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse
coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of
basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms
function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms
allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then
serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each
atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of
sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image
editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of
unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the
effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,
where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse
combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline
fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a
crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of
mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient
framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier
removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly
available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.
Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted
their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the
robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation
and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors
and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a
fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for
real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern
augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,
achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5
of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,
our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited
for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study
underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when
designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Motivation: 准确追踪管状树结构（如血管和气道）对于医学任务至关重要，但现有模型存在重复分支和过早终止的问题。

Method: 提出了 Trexplorer Super，通过新方法改进原模型，并开发了三个难度递增的中心线数据集（一个合成，两个真实）用于评估。

Result: Trexplorer Super 在所有数据集上均优于现有 SOTA 模型，且合成数据的强表现不一定适用于真实数据。

Conclusion: Trexplorer Super 显著提升了中心线追踪性能，同时公开的数据集和代码为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Tubular tree structures, such as blood vessels and airways, are essential in
human anatomy and accurately tracking them while preserving their topology is
crucial for various downstream tasks. Trexplorer is a recurrent model designed
for centerline tracking in 3D medical images but it struggles with predicting
duplicate branches and terminating tracking prematurely. To address these
issues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves
performance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking
models is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough
evaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,
each with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare
them with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on
every dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic
data does not necessarily translate to real datasets. The code and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于AI的天气预报模型取得了显著进展，但Transformer架构的高复杂性和资源需求限制了其应用。本文旨在通过现代化CNN架构解决这一问题。

Method: KAI-a采用尺度不变架构和InceptionNeXt模块，结合地球物理感知设计，训练于ERA5数据集，仅需12小时完成训练。

Result: KAI-a在中期天气预报中表现与现有最佳模型相当，且计算需求大幅降低，同时能有效捕捉极端天气事件。

Conclusion: KAI-a为轻量级天气预报模型提供了可行方案，兼具高性能和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances.
These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP
systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction.
However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often
leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive
parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for
global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while
significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic
modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across
multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a
scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a
geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.
Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model
contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on
a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the
performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,
while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on
the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate
KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical
utility.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了标签不一致问题，平衡了预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: GeoDistill为跨视图定位提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view localization, the task of estimating a camera's
3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose by aligning ground-level images with
satellite images, is crucial for large-scale outdoor applications like
autonomous navigation and augmented reality. Existing methods often rely on
fully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.
In this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self
distillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View
(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view
localization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,
while the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart
created by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those
of the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores
textureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions
and reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas
or limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly
improves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we
introduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative
orientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill
provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view
localization challenges. Code and model can be found at

*Zhengyi Xu,Haoran Wu,Wen Jiang,Jie Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAPL-SCD的图聚合原型学习方法，用于解决语义变化检测中的多任务优化问题，通过自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义变化检测（SCD）需要同时优化多个任务，容易因任务间冲突导致负迁移，因此需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了多任务联合优化框架，结合语义分割和变化检测的主任务以及图聚合原型学习的辅助任务，采用自适应权重分配和梯度旋转方法。

Result: 在SECOND和Landsat-SCD数据集上取得了最先进的性能，显著提升了SCD任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GAPL-SCD方法通过多任务优化和特征交互模块，有效解决了语义变化检测中的任务冲突问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to
provide not only the change locations but also the detailed "from-to"
categories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic
insights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of
applications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of
multiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific
learning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we
propose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in
remote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization
method is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and
change detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype
learning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to
alleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning
capabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module
constructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as
class proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and
reducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed
self-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion
modules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving
performance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and
Landsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸修复方法在视觉质量上有显著提升，但身份不确定性（如模糊输入和随机生成过程）仍未解决。

Method: RIDFR利用预训练扩散模型，结合内容注入模块和身份注入模块，并通过对齐学习抑制ID无关语义干扰。

Result: 实验表明，RIDFR优于现有方法，重建出高质量、高身份保真度的结果，并表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDFR通过创新框架解决了身份不确定性问题，为人脸修复领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant
advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion
priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by
identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved.
To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration
(RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion
models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in
conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection
Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module
integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR
incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from
multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the
interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up,
hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with
high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Sports action classification representing complex body postures and
player-object interactions is an emerging area in image-based sports analysis.
Some works have contributed to automated sports action recognition using
machine learning techniques over the past decades. However, sufficient image
datasets representing women sports actions with enough intra- and inter-class
variations are not available to the researchers. To overcome this limitation,
this work presents a new dataset named WomenSports for women sports
classification using small-scale training data. This dataset includes a variety
of sports activities, covering wide variations in movements, environments, and
interactions among players. In addition, this study proposes a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for deep feature extraction. A channel attention scheme
upon local contextual regions is applied to refine and enhance feature
representation. The experiments are carried out on three different sports
datasets and one dance dataset for generalizing the proposed algorithm, and the
performances on these datasets are noteworthy. The deep learning method
achieves 89.15% top-1 classification accuracy using ResNet-50 on the proposed
WomenSports dataset, which is publicly available for research at Mendeley Data.

Conclusion: 新架构通过高效的特征提取和注意力优化，提升了人-物交互检测的性能。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately
localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects,
providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various
domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable
predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and
inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a
wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture
tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of
expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features
from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional
filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention
by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and
mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated
intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with
emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results
on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential
of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法未解决遮挡问题，且现有方法需配对遮挡与完整序列，不切实际。

Result: 在Gait3D、GREW和BRIAR数据集上验证，显著提升遮挡步态识别性能且不影响完整步态识别。

Conclusion: 残差学习是解决遮挡步态识别并保留完整步态性能的有效技术。

Abstract: Gait is becoming popular as a method of person re-identification because of
its ability to identify people at a distance. However, most current works in
gait recognition do not address the practical problem of occlusions. Among
those which do, some require paired tuples of occluded and holistic sequences,
which are impractical to collect in the real world. Further, these approaches
work on occlusions but fail to retain performance on holistic inputs. To
address these challenges, we propose RG-Gait, a method for residual correction
for occluded gait recognition with holistic retention. We model the problem as
a residual learning task, conceptualizing the occluded gait signature as a
residual deviation from the holistic gait representation. Our proposed network
adaptively integrates the learned residual, significantly improving performance
on occluded gait sequences without compromising the holistic recognition
accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR
datasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to
tackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

TL;DR: SpaRTAN是一种轻量级架构设计，通过多阶空间特征和通道聚合模块提升性能，同时在ImageNet和COCO上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN和Transformer在视觉任务中的简单性偏差和信息冗余问题。

Method: 使用不同感受野的核和波状通道聚合模块，动态捕捉和增强特征。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上达到77.7%准确率（3.8M参数），COCO上50.0% AP（21.5M参数）。

Conclusion: SpaRTAN通过高效设计实现了高性能和参数效率。

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition
tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival
transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and
ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a
simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural
representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin
to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information
redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive
performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight
architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information
processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled
by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order
spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further
modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise
redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently
gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental
results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable
parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,
on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M
parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver
strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it
achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M
parameters. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 零样本异常检测在工业应用中需求广泛，但现有方法存在性能不足的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合特征匹配与跨模态对齐，利用批处理测试和文本信息过滤噪声，同时恢复CLIP的局部语义相关性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等基准测试中，FiSeCLIP在异常分类和分割任务上表现优于现有方法，如AU-ROC和F1-max分别提升4.6%和5.7%。

Conclusion: FiSeCLIP为零样本异常检测提供了更强基线，展示了CLIP模型在细粒度任务中的潜力。

Abstract: With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot
settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in
recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many
applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with
training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the
cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while
batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within
a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes
other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image.
However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we
apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we
further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local
\textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection
tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits
superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on
anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction,
e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by
+4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的放射学报告虽然流畅，但因数据偏差导致医学不准确，限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过细粒度跨模态语义识别医学关键特征的显著区域，并在图像建模和报告生成中系统关注这些区域。

Result: 在IU-Xray和MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现优于同类方法。

Conclusion: SISRNet能有效捕捉细微异常，减轻数据偏差影响，生成临床准确的报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays
using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the
arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data
bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely
distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate
reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this
issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided
(SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly
identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using
fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on
these high-information regions during both image modeling and report
generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the
negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate
reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on
widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

Motivation: 解决传统GAN或扩散模型在医学图像转换中边界一致性和临床偏好对齐的不足。

Method: 结合GAN先验和人类反馈的条件扩散，通过迭代优化和锦标赛选择内部化人类偏好。

Result: 在临床数据集上表现优异，定量指标（RMSE、SSIM等）优于现有方法，仅需10步采样。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且有效，适用于实时、偏好对齐的医学图像转换。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the
Schrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with
human-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion
models, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT
inputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual
controllability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free
guidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically
preferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based
preference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying
on a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed
method selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while
preserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate
superior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical
datasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --
while requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the
effectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned
medical image translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割（OVSS）无法处理用户个性化文本描述（如“我的马克杯”），导致无法分割用户感兴趣的特定区域。

Method: 提出了一种文本提示调优的插件方法，结合负掩模提议和视觉嵌入注入，减少误预测并增强文本提示的表征。

Result: 在FSS$^\text{per}$、CUB$^\text{per}$和ADE$^\text{per}$等新基准上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不影响原始OVSS性能的情况下，显著提升了个性化开放词汇语义分割的效果。

Abstract: While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into
semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes
unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug
cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper
addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed
\textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text
prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual
concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the
performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false
predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our
proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts
other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by
enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of
the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS
without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the
superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task,
including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现最优，兼具鲁棒性和实时性。

Conclusion: DGFDNet通过双域协同和物理引导，显著提升了去雾效果和效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in
single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time
applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features
to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and
often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce
frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches
limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the
Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel
dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment
across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two
key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a
pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance
haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware
spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which
fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid
gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior
Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback
mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed
features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in
challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze
datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at:

Conclusion: FootGait3D在生物力学、临床步态分析和机器人应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for
advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate
surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is
inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.
Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of
high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.
Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or
lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of
the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address
this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46
subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a
complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)
along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.
This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud
completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset
is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of
state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and
multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the
challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D
has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment
foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,
prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of
the foot during motion. The dataset is now available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学语言引导分割方法依赖成对的图像-文本输入，导致大量无文本的医学图像数据无法充分利用，且限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出ProLearn框架，引入原型驱动语义近似（PSA）模块，通过离散原型空间近似语义指导，减少对文本输入的依赖。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19、MosMedData+和Kvasir-SEG数据集上，ProLearn在文本有限的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProLearn通过原型驱动学习有效解决了语言引导分割的文本依赖问题，提升了分割性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as
auxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant
improvements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired
image-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance", presents two
fundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired
reports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for
training; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with
paired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where
segmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we
propose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for
language-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At
its core, in ProLearn, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic
Approximation (PSA) module to enable approximation of semantic guidance from
textual input. PSA initializes a discrete and compact prototype space by
distilling segmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once
initialized, it supports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates
semantic guidance for images without textual input, thereby alleviating textual
reliance. Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG
demonstrate that ProLearn outperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods
when limited text is available.

TL;DR: RoMaP提出了一种新的局部3D高斯编辑框架，解决了现有方法在多视角分割和SDS损失模糊性上的不足，实现了精确且大幅度的部分级别修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D神经表示和实例级编辑模型在实现精确局部3D编辑时面临挑战，尤其是高斯泼溅中的多视角分割不一致和SDS损失的模糊性问题。

Method: RoMaP框架包括两部分：1) 3D-GALP模块，通过球形谐波系数建模视角依赖的标签变化，生成准确的分割；2) 正则化SDS损失，结合标准SDS损失和额外正则项（如L1锚定损失），限制编辑范围并提升灵活性。

Result: 实验表明，RoMaP在重建和生成的高斯场景中实现了最先进的局部3D编辑效果，定性和定量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoMaP为3D高斯编辑提供了更鲁棒和灵活的部分级别修改能力，推动了高质量3D内容的创建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing
models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However,
achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian
Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently
ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these
limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that
enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a
robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction
(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model
view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and
consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a
regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional
regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled
Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality
part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region
while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as
Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond
the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local
3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects
qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and
flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Result: 在花样滑冰和霹雳舞等挑战性场景中，JAR方法优于现有HPE改进网络。

Conclusion: 基于关节角度的建模和高质量数据集显著提升了HPE的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in
various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint
recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing
kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models
for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in
which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method
to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key
techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is
robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation
of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground
truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a
post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet.
Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network
demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and
smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based
refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in
challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Result: 实验表明GKNet在精度和有效性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GKNet和SKD数据集为非合作航天器的姿态估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft is significant for
on-orbit service (OOS) tasks, such as satellite maintenance, space debris
removal, and station assembly. Considering the high demands on pose estimation
accuracy, mainstream monocular pose estimation methods typically consist of
keypoint detectors and PnP solver. However, current keypoint detectors remain
vulnerable to structural symmetry and partial occlusion of non-cooperative
spacecraft. To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the
monocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages
the geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate
keypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft
keypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000
simulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.
Extensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy
and effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft
keypoint detectors. The code for GKNet and the SKD dataset is available at
https://github.com/Dongzhou-1996/GKNet.

Motivation: 解决GPR图像中道路地下病害识别依赖人工且效率低下的问题，同时克服深度学习在数据稀缺和网络区分能力不足上的限制。

Method: 构建了包含2134个样本的3D GPR数据集，并提出基于YOLO模型的交叉验证策略，利用不同扫描图像的敏感性差异提升识别效果。

Result: 在实地测试中实现了超过98.6%的召回率，并将检测工作量减少了约90%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自动化和高准确率的识别，显著提升了道路地下病害检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive
solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition
from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise.
Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its
current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset
for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD.
In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of
diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that
the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits
varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel
cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition,
achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an
online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助输入和简化物理近似，缺乏标准化3D基准，且可能引入不确定性或未能充分捕捉真实辐射传输和大气散射-吸收效应。

Method: 提出FourCastX模型，结合WRF和增强的COSP模拟器生成高质量3D散射体积数据，嵌入ATB-BC物理约束，提升恢复效果。

Result: 在Atmos-Bench数据集上，FourCastX在355 nm和532 nm波段均优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: Atmos-Bench为卫星3D大气结构恢复设定了新标准，有助于更深入的气候研究。

Abstract: Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered
from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view
of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human
activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing
methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based
approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation.
However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and
insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric
scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench:
the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX:
Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a)
generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm
and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean
time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC
physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency
during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench
dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art
baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a
new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves
the way for deeper climate insight.

Abstract: In recent years, visual recognition methods have advanced significantly,
finding applications across diverse fields. While researchers seek to
understand the mechanisms behind the success of these models, there is also a
growing impetus to deploy them in critical areas like autonomous driving and
medical diagnostics to better diagnose failures, which promotes the development
of interpretability research. This paper systematically reviews existing
research on the interpretability of visual recognition models and proposes a
taxonomy of methods from a human-centered perspective. The proposed taxonomy
categorizes interpretable recognition methods based on Intent, Object,
Presentation, and Methodology, thereby establishing a systematic and coherent
set of grouping criteria for these XAI methods. Additionally, we summarize the
requirements for evaluation metrics and explore new opportunities enabled by
recent technologies, such as large multimodal models. We aim to organize
existing research in this domain and inspire future investigations into the
interpretability of visual recognition models.

Conclusion: KptLLM++ 为细粒度图像理解提供了统一解决方案，推动了人机交互的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized
image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these
models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as
the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as
structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,
particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as
fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In
this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that
specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the
integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By
unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself
as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The
model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first
interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise
positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push
the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over
500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,
and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++
to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate
its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified
solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative
implications for human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Jellyfish, a diverse group of gelatinous marine organisms, play a crucial
role in maintaining marine ecosystems but pose significant challenges for
biodiversity and conservation due to their rapid proliferation and ecological
impact. Accurate identification of jellyfish species is essential for
ecological monitoring and management. In this study, we proposed a deep

combined with seven traditional machine learning classifiers and three
Feedforward Neural Network classifiers for precise species identification.
Additionally, we activated the softmax function to directly classify jellyfish
species using the convolutional neural network models. The combination of the
Artificial Neural Network with MobileNetV3 is our best-performing model,
achieving an exceptional accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming other
feature extractor-classifier combinations. This study demonstrates the efficacy
of deep learning and hybrid frameworks in addressing biodiversity challenges
and advancing species detection in marine environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习框架（HSGL），通过结合文本和视觉模态定义、生成和优化硬样本，提升了服装变化行人重识别（CC-ReID）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬样本在行人重识别任务中具有挑战性，尤其是在服装变化场景下，其模糊性和缺乏明确定义限制了模型的鲁棒性。

Method: HSGL框架包含双粒度硬样本生成（DGHSG）和硬样本自适应学习（HSAL），前者利用多模态线索生成语义一致的样本，后者通过硬度感知优化策略调整特征距离。

Conclusion: 多模态引导的硬样本生成与学习为CC-ReID任务提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型的判别能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)
tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent
ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes
them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of
targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under
clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which
is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly
define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL
comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation
(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent
samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives
for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)
Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware
optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic
labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives
closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability
and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the
potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust
CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the
targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
PRCC and LTCC datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: MMOne框架有效解决了多模态场景表示中的模态冲突问题，为多模态学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact
with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities
enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts,
arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two
critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address
these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple
modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional
modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality
indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.
Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate
multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality
differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by
disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific
components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene
representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to
additional modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the
extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of
human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural
resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the
extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or
highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model
which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide
events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain
free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote
sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for
two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our
proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,
and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,
93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU
scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,
Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our
proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

Abstract: Citrus, as one of the most economically important fruit crops globally,
suffers severe yield depressions due to various diseases. Accurate disease
detection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing
targeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,
particularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially
decreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of
detection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on
massive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising
performance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids
and a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a
novel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation
learning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages
over existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;
(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus
diseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,
outperforming existing methods by 4.5\%-30.1\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method
narrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are
labeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on
other evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the
robustness against the class imbalance challenge.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural
image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their
competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs,
ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert,
OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model
performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding
and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large
general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts
on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to
medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than
understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third,
performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task
design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the
reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for
stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation
protocols.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete
multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy
protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various
incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality
combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical
limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict
with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction
model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank
adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a
novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal
learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination
aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The
MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct
characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts
the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each
modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across
different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms
previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成模型的研究潜力巨大，但缺乏专门的评估基准，现有基准仅支持简单叙事提示，无法全面评估叙事表达能力。

Result: 实验表明，NarrLV的评估指标与人类判断高度一致，揭示了当前模型在叙事表达上的能力边界。

Conclusion: NarrLV填补了长视频生成模型评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long
video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to
expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long
video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to
accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due
to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video
generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on
benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our
knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively
evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.
Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative
unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative
Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.
Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we
construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing
evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based
on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an
effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and
answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on
existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human
judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability
boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

Conclusion: 该方法为连续敏感属性的公平性评估和去偏提供了有效工具，适合工业应用。

Abstract: Within a legal framework, fairness in datasets and models is typically
assessed by dividing observations into predefined groups and then computing
fairness measures (e.g., Disparate Impact or Equality of Odds with respect to
gender). However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,
dividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination
experienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we
propose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly
multidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed
levels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a
novel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby
isolating the most critical subgroups.
  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and
demonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing
how discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.
Furthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the
case of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging
the skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that
the proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than
previously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for
a given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,
aiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing. The
results demonstrate that our approach improves fairness while having minimal
impact on accuracy, thus confirming our partition method and opening the door
for industrial deployment.

Abstract: Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of
deep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for
detecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image
data from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the
detection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising
solution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting
models exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,
particularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and
background contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive
framework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the
pre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks
and image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and
masked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided
by mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the
mask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated
effects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask
edges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for
subsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a
multimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and
reasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic
dataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and
diverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection
models. Code is available at https://github.com/wghr123/MFGDiffusion.

Conclusion: ViewSRD通过结构化多视角分解和跨模态一致性视图标记，显著提升了3D视觉定位的精度。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based
on textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling
targets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving
inconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To
tackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D
visual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the
Simple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor
queries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a
structured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional
relationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the
Multi-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates
textual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal
Consistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a
Textual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a
unified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding
datasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Conclusion: YOLOatr在热红外目标识别任务中表现出色，解决了现有模型的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared
(TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer
vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception
domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific
challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater
distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution
and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,
temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios
all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class
similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,
contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform
in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,
called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the
detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR
dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing
protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

cascading model deep learning framework combining MobileNetv3 for
classification, YOLOv11 for object detection, and MaskRCNN for segmentation.
Through AI vs. Human analysis involving five domain experts, we demonstrate
that the models trained on our dataset achieve accuracy and speed comparable to

Abstract: In this paper, we study task-oriented human grasp synthesis, a new grasp
synthesis task that demands both task and context awareness. At the core of our
method is the task-aware contact maps. Unlike traditional contact maps that
only reason about the manipulated object and its relation with the hand, our
enhanced maps take into account scene and task information. This comprehensive
map is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses
that align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs
a task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent
stage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We
introduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our
approach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and
task, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both
grasp quality and task performance. See our project page for more details:

Abstract: Fluvial erosion is a natural process that can generate significant impacts on
soil stability and strategic infrastructures. The detection and monitoring of
this phenomenon is traditionally addressed by photogrammetric methods and
analysis in geographic information systems. These tasks require specific
knowledge and intensive manual processing. This study proposes an artificial

adjusted by fine-tuning and trained with photographs and LiDAR images, is used.
This combined dataset was segmented and labeled using the Roboflow platform.
Experimental results indicate efficient detection of erosion patterns with an
accuracy of 70%, precise identification of eroded areas and reliable
calculation of their extent in pixels and square meters. As a final product,
the EROSCAN system has been developed, an interactive web application that
allows users to upload images and obtain automatic segmentations of fluvial
erosion, together with the estimated area. This tool optimizes the detection
and quantification of the phenomenon, facilitating decision making in risk
management and territorial planning.

Result: 实验证明框架有效，实现了高精度的表面重建。

Conclusion: 多基元高斯泼溅框架显著提升了表面重建的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has received a lot of attention in surface
reconstruction. However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes
in the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type
of splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent
object surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that
this can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.
Thus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian
Splatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its
surface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first
propose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and
rendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.
In addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based
initialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its
surface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging
different types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our
framework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.

Motivation: 现有MVS方法在纹理缺失和反射区域表现不佳，而单目深度估计在这些区域具有优势，因此提出结合两者的方法。

Method: 通过注意力机制整合单目特征，动态更新深度候选，并设计相对一致性损失监督深度预测。

Result: 在DTU和Tanks-and-Temples数据集上达到SOTA性能，排名第一。

Conclusion: MonoMVSNet通过结合单目深度估计与多视几何，显著提升了MVS在挑战性区域的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for
a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However,
existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as
textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In
contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature
matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these
regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature
and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular
foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of
the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention
mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the
monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the
depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a
relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to
supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and
Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate
and Advanced benchmarks. The source code is available at

Conclusion: UGC-VideoCap为无约束真实场景下的多模态视频字幕生成提供了高质量基础和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often
feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video
captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric,
overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker
intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,
capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video
understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new
benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal
captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,
UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,
featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage
human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio
visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs
probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we
propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from
Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine
tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach
enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive
performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation
and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in
unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为模型提供了更深的可解释性，有助于理解其行为。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of
Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that
embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training,
these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.
However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding
space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image
attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the
dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a
physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on
controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with
synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that
the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,
providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper
interpretability. Code available here:

Abstract: Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative
to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on
its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific
downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many
techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially
private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation
data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In
our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them
to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms
DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which
necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR. Code is available

Result: 在两个医学影像数据集上，COLI在PSNR和SSIM指标上表现优异，压缩速度提升4倍。

Conclusion: COLI为大规模图像压缩提供了高效解决方案，平衡了速度、压缩比和图像质量。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery
amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional
techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while
data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous
mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,
thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the
generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces
challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.
To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),
a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,
recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we
accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,
mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a
parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image
storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a
novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while
maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging
datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior
PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while
accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

and scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.
We introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular
geometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with
diffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained
aortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates
anatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker
distributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts
a hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that
generates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial
profiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of
anatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot
conditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical
applications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust
reconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device
optimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge
image-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration
of NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.

Motivation: 解决在退化成像条件下鲁棒的圆检测和拟合这一计算机视觉基础问题。

Method: 结合高效的组合边缘像素采样和卷积参数空间密度估计。

Result: 在真实医学数据、合成数据和不同分辨率/异常值条件下，3C-FBI实现了最高精度（Jaccard指数0.896）和实时性能（40.3 fps），显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 3C-FBI在精度、速度和鲁棒性上的优异表现使其适用于医疗影像、机器人和工业检测等挑战性场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust
circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present
Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an
algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric
fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling
and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.
  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world
medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),
(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,
and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier
contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3
fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a
standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost
1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher
than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.
  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989
across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024,
0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and
robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial
inspection under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于人类感知的模糊颜色模型COLIBRI，通过模糊集和逻辑构建颜色分类框架，实验验证其优于传统颜色模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机难以模仿人类颜色感知的问题，缩小计算颜色表示与人类视觉感知之间的差距。

Method: 采用三阶段实验方法，包括初步实验确定可区分颜色刺激、大规模人类分类调查（1000+受试者），并基于数据提取模糊分区和生成隶属函数。

Result: 模型在人类感知对齐方面优于RGB、HSV和LAB等传统颜色模型，且具有适应性和反馈机制。

Conclusion: COLIBRI模型在设计和人机交互等领域具有重要意义，填补了大规模人类样本颜色属性建模的研究空白。

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans
perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for
computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human
Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based
Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between
computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed
model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.
Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies
distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through
preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey
involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract
fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world
perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that
allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to
traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for
color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable
sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for
fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer
interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown promise in various
applications, such as motor imagery and cognitive state monitoring. However,
decoding visual representations from EEG signals remains a significant
challenge due to their complex and noisy nature. We thus propose a novel
5-stage framework for decoding visual representations from EEG signals: (1) an
EEG encoder for concept classification, (2) cross-modal alignment of EEG and
text embeddings in CLIP feature space, (3) caption refinement via re-ranking,
(4) weighted interpolation of concept and caption embeddings for richer
semantics, and (5) image generation using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model.
We enable context-aware EEG-to-image generation through cross-modal alignment
and re-ranking. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality images aligned with visual stimuli, outperforming SOTA approaches
by 13.43% in Classification Accuracy, 15.21% in Generation Accuracy and
reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance by 36.61%, indicating superior semantic
alignment and image quality.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成一致内容时无法保持背景细节和身份一致性，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实现了对前景和背景的细粒度一致性，支持连续或离散场景中的角色生成。

Conclusion: CharaConsist是首个针对DiT模型的文本到图像一致性生成方法，扩展了实际应用范围。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, producing a series of consistent contents that
preserve the same identity is highly valuable for real-world applications.
Although a few works have explored training-free methods to enhance the
consistency of generated subjects, we observe that they suffer from the
following problems. First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,
which limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character
undergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing
details become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,
which employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with
decoupled control of the foreground and background. CharaConsist enables
fine-grained consistency for both foreground and background, supporting the
generation of one character in continuous shots within a fixed scene or in
discrete shots across different scenes. Moreover, CharaConsist is the first
consistent generation method tailored for text-to-image DiT model. Its ability
to maintain fine-grained consistency, combined with the larger capacity of
latest base model, enables it to produce high-quality visual outputs,
broadening its applicability to a wider range of real-world scenarios. The

Result: 在多个4D几何感知基准测试中表现优异，推理速度显著提升，同时保持高质量空间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和交互式4D视觉系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a
fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and
real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer
that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We
explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer
architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal
causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to
enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle
real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information
while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we
propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry
grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model
supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,
FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments
on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model
increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive
performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision, crucial for
applications such as 3D reconstruction, free-viewpoint rendering, robotics,
autonomous driving, and AR/VR technologies. Traditional methods relying on
hardware sensors like LiDAR are often limited by high costs, low resolution,
and environmental sensitivity, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. Recent advances in vision-based methods offer a promising
alternative, yet they face challenges in generalization and stability due to
either the low-capacity model architectures or the reliance on domain-specific
and small-scale datasets. The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models
in other domains has inspired the development of "depth foundation models":
deep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot
generalization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning
architectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,
multi-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these
models to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of
large-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key
architectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards
robust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research
and applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CLS-DM的模型，通过跨模态特征对比学习，解决2D X射线与3D CT图像在潜在空间对齐的问题，显著提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果。


<details>

Motivation: 传统CT重建方法存在时间消耗大和辐射暴露高的问题，稀疏X射线图像重建方法成为研究热点，但现有扩散模型在2D与3D模态潜在空间对齐方面表现不足。

Method: 提出CLS-DM模型，结合跨模态特征对比学习，从2D X射线图像中高效提取3D潜在信息，实现模态间的潜在空间对齐。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI和CTSpine1K数据集上，CLS-DM在PSNR和SSIM等体素级指标上优于经典和最新生成模型。

Conclusion: CLS-DM不仅提升了稀疏X射线重建CT的效果和经济性，还可推广至其他跨模态转换任务，如文本到图像合成。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical
settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D
spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant
time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based
on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from
researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent
years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have
demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.
Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent
representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT
modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment
within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent
Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature
contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray
images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental
results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art
generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the
LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing
the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but
can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as
text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research
and applications in other domains.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习和物理驱动优化结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial
for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper
presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),
which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the
3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning
(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based
constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:
i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$
is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic
sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging
spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for
the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current
flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer
then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to
minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The
results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information
with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction
in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining
DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for
reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to
complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited
annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions
Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity
Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically
combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a
wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a
biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature
enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained
and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate
uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and
lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without
sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate
that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an
average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap
error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the
3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of
1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different
datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in
providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor
segmentation.
