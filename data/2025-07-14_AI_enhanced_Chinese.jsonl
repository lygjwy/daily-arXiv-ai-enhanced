Since these HPO tools\nhave been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem\nsetups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as\nmulti-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the\npractical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box\ncombinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,\nchemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet\nvery important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial\noptimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the\ncategorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a\ndistance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for\nthe newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space.

A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking\ninspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a\nparametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward\nChaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner.

Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy\nof 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID\ndata distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u673a\u5236\uff08MMA\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1MMA\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728IID\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53476.84%\u548c7.25%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMMA\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This is problematic in engineering systems where minor\nviolations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and\nconsistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN\narchitecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality\nconstraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the\nfeasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a\ndistance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT\nconditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse\nsystem with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection\ndifferentiable.

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL.

This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of\nattention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare\nperformance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining\nstrategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data\nfeatures. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model\nperformance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns\nthrough internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding\nmultimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis\nto investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be\napplied to broader research areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5168\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709ICL\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMMs\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001ICL\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cICEs\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e3a\u5206\u6790LMMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u5916\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08shot\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6807\u9898\u5206\u914d\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u6f14\u793a\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790LMMs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ICEs\u914d\u7f6e\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LMMs\u7684\u5178\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLMMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001ICL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle\nwith sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward\nGaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to\nincorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into\na globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an\nentropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal\ntransport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an\nalignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.\nFurthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the\n$\\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This\nenables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating\ncamera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets\ndemonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high\nfidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view\nsynthesis.

At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural\nlanguage queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the\nproblem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the\nlower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows\nor executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision\nmaking.

In this paper, we advocate for a\ncausal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially\ndistributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect\nrelationships.

This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of\ncurrent SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.\nEmploying zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their\nperformance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative\nstrengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five\nstate-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against\nthree LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding\ntasks.

Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class\nseverity tasks (a drop of over 30\\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical\nunderstanding challenges transcend model scale.

For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of\nconvolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through\nconsecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and\nmemory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer\nlayers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For\ntransformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head\nattention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is\ncomputationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the\nresolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by\nlearnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator\nwhich has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier\ntransform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the\nfrequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,\nfast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the\nBraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS\nshowed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model\nparameters.

While\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains\ninsufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level\nplan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce\neffective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.\nIn this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex\nReasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of\nhigh-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Krul\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dLLM\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "Krul\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u9009\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aKrul\u5728TTFT\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.5x-2.68x\u548c1.33x-2.35x\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ntabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance\non classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,\nnon-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing\nnumerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces\nQuantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into\nan LLM-based imputation architecture.

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

To\naddress the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial\nattacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range\nrepresentations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from\na steganalysis perspective.

Furthermore, a\nfeatures angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated\nstegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's\nclassified features.

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods.

Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSSR\u7684\u65b0\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u81ea\u68c0OCR\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u5728DIMT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8OCR\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u5728OCR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728DIMT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6311\u6218\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4OCR\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SSR\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u524d\u5148\u751f\u6210OCR\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176OCR\u80fd\u529b\u8f85\u52a9\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSSR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728OCR\u548cDIMT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Low-light visual understanding,\nconstrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain\nadaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a\ngeneralized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,\nwhich we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU).

Two primary\nstrategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on\nground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a\nlarger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear\ncomparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under\npractical conditions is needed.\n  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of\ndifferent sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a\nstrong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model\nsizes and architectures.

Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,\nMDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each\nclass, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.\nHowever, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash\ncenters, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may\ndegrade retrieval performance.\n  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the\nidea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of\nsemantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those\nof unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a\nthree-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic\nstructure.\n  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities\nbetween classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to\nvarying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to\ngenerate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing\na minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.\nFinally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to\nconvert images into binary hash codes.\n  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public\ndatasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.\nSpecifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%\nin MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08SHC\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7c7b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002SHC\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u7c7b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b3. \u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSHC\u5728MAP@100\u3001MAP@1000\u548cMAP@ALL\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e867.26%\u30017.62%\u548c11.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHC\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making.

We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly.

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals.

The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance.

We train agents\nin the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that\nimprovement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the\nagents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the\n'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the\n'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without\nadditional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the\n$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the\n'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)\na GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining\na $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over\nexisting unsupervised image-captioning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLoGIC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoGIC\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u548c\u503e\u542c\u8005\u4e24\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0bBLEU\u5f97\u520646\uff08\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c31\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf2\u5206\u548c10\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "LoGIC\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5f55\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97ASR\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83ASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u5355\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8f6c\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14ASR\u8f6c\u5f55\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8f6c\u5f55\u3002", "conclusion": "ASR\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5f55\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f6c\u5f55\u9519\u8bef\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

We formalize this practical problem as \\textit{Continual-Temporal\nTest-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over\ntime.

However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of\nan autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited\nwhen combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to\ndynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,\nwhich combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This\nstructure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal\nmemory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time\nto maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion\nNetwork (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion\nfeatures from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV\nfeatures with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal\nfeature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which\ncaptures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features.

However, 7T scanners are costly,\nscarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.\nWe propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize\n7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus\nwas superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T\nincreased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely\non 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI.

To mitigate this we propose the\nuse of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)\nfeatures (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of\nthe total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various\nscales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,\northogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are\nempirically lowly correlated.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u653e\u5bbd\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6620\u5c04\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230100%\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u7a7a\u6d1e\u7684\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.
