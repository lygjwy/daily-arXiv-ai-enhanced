### [1] [Think Clearly: Improving Reasoning via Redundant Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08806)
*Daewon Choi,Jimin Lee,Jihoon Tack,Woomin Song,Saket Dingliwal,Sai Muralidhar Jayanthi,Bhavana Ganesh,Jinwoo Shin,Aram Galstyan,Sravan Babu Bodapati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过去除推理过程中的冗余注意力来提高模型性能的方法，显著提升了数学竞赛等推理密集型任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长链推理中存在冗余注意力问题，导致注意力分散，尤其是在错误答案中更为明显。

Method: 通过测量特殊结束标记的注意力分数识别冗余，采用结构感知剪枝去除低贡献推理块，最后恢复推理生成。

Result: 方法显著提升了推理密集型任务的准确性，尤其在数学竞赛基准（如AIME和AMC）上表现突出。

Conclusion: 去除推理冗余能显著提升模型性能，无需额外训练即可实现。

Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form
reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final
answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include
substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention
scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater
attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing
this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance
through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we
systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention
scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit
instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,
we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in
low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting
redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then
resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any
training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on
challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where
reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

### [2] [A New Approach for Multicriteria Assessment in the Ranking of Alternatives Using Cardinal and Ordinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08875)
*Fuh-Hwa Franklin Liu,Su-Chuan Shih*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合两种虚拟差距分析（VGA）模型的新型多准则评估（MCA）方法，以提高评估的效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多准则评估中假设和主观判断带来的挑战，同时结合定量和定性标准。

Method: 利用基于线性规划的VGA框架，结合两种VGA模型进行多准则评估。

Result: 通过两个数值示例验证了方法的准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动决策系统和决策支持系统提供了强大且灵活的解决方案，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria
Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of
Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several
criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be
influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation
challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to
incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of
cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion
values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed,
significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine
the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines
two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear
programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves
efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and
dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive
numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed
method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress
in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

*Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,Jayd Matyas,Logan Cross,Davide Paglieri,Minsuk Chang,William A. Cunningham,Simon Osindero,William S. Isaac,Joel Z. Leibo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于桌游角色扮演游戏（TTRPGs）的灵活场景定义框架，用于支持生成式AI在多角色环境中的多样化应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足生成式AI在模拟、叙事和评估等多样化应用中的需求，需要一个灵活的框架。

Method: 借鉴TTRPGs中的游戏主持人（GM）概念，采用实体-组件架构模式，将GM设计为可配置的实体。

Result: 通过分离实现细节和组件配置，实现了快速迭代、模块化和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Concordia库的实践证明了该框架在灵活配置场景方面的有效性。

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging
from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation.
Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist,
Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition
framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from
tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible
for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly
determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the
Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM
is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed
of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a
separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an
engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and
configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the
components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid
iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We
describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this
philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure
scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioAnalyst是一个基于Transformer架构的AI基础模型，专为生物多样性分析和保护规划设计，通过多模态数据预训练，适用于多种下游任务，并在数据稀缺场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物多样性加速丧失对生态研究和保护策略提出严峻挑战，需要综合监测和预测能力。AI基础模型在科学领域展现出潜力，因此开发了BioAnalyst以应对这一需求。

Method: BioAnalyst采用Transformer架构，预训练于多模态数据集（物种记录、遥感指标、气候环境变量），可微调用于物种分布建模、栖息地评估等任务。

Result: 模型在两个下游用例中表现优于现有方法，尤其在数据稀缺场景中，为生态预测设立了新的准确性基准。

Conclusion: BioAnalyst的开放发布旨在推动生物多样性建模的合作，并推进AI驱动的生态解决方案。

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for
ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of
biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the
sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats,
including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive
species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local
and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and
conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation
Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by
leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to
various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity
conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model
tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst
employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal
datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,
climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,
allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species
distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species
detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's
performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability
compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two
distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological
forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to
the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in
biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological
challenges.

### [5] [Measuring the Impact of Early-2025 AI on Experienced Open-Source Developer Productivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089)
*Joel Becker,Nate Rush,Elizabeth Barnes,David Rein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管开发者预期AI工具能缩短任务完成时间，但实际使用AI工具反而增加了19%的时间，与经济学和ML专家的预测相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI工具对经验丰富的开源开发者生产力的实际影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 采用随机对照试验（RCT），16名有中等AI经验的开发者完成246项任务，随机分配是否使用2025年的AI工具（如Cursor Pro和Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet）。

Result: 允许使用AI工具时，任务完成时间增加了19%，与开发者预期的20%减少和专家预测的38-39%减少相反。

Conclusion: AI工具在实际应用中可能因多种因素（如项目规模、质量标准或开发者经验）导致效率下降，而非提升。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development
in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the
productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate
AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an
average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow
or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers
primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet.
Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce
completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that
allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing
AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers
down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39%
shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and
evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could
contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality
standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although
the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the
robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely
to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

*Ronghua Shi,Yiou Liu,Xinyu Ying,Yang Tan,Yuchun Feng,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi,Xuhui Wang,Zhuang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习（MARL）的框架，用于检测去中心化金融（DeFi）中的市场操纵行为，通过动态对抗游戏建模操纵者与检测者之间的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeFi的无许可创新带来了市场操纵问题，缺乏中心化监管导致恶意行为者通过协调操纵手段（如炒作和拉盘）影响市场。

Method: 采用MARL框架，提出GRPO优化学习稳定性，理论驱动的奖励函数区分价格发现与操纵噪声，多模态智能体管道整合语义特征、社交图信号和链上数据。

Result: 在真实数据和对抗模拟中验证，Hide-and-Shill系统在检测准确性和因果归因方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究将多智能体系统与金融监控结合，为去中心化市场情报提供了新范式，所有资源开源以促进研究可复现性。

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless
financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without
centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and
pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation
detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a
dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using
delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces
three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance
learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a
theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information
asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a
multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social
graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The
framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent
architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning
through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony
promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust
manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time
surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world
discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill
achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This
work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new
paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at
the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and
reproducibility.

### [7] [When Developer Aid Becomes Security Debt: A Systematic Analysis of Insecure Behaviors in LLM Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09329)
*Matous Kozak,Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam,Siva Sivaraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文首次系统评估了基于LLM的编码代理的安全性，发现21%的操作存在安全问题，并提出了检测系统和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于LLM的编码代理在软件开发中的广泛应用，但其安全性尚未被充分理解，可能导致不安全实践。

Method: 分析了五个先进模型（如GPT-4o、GPT-4.1等）在93个实际软件任务中的12,000多个操作，开发了高精度检测系统。

Result: 21%的操作存在安全问题，信息暴露（CWE-200）最常见；GPT-4.1的缓解成功率高达96.8%。

Conclusion: 研究为编码代理安全性评估提供了首个综合框架，强调下一代LLM编码代理需具备安全设计。

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development,
yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while
capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce
insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of
autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five
state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world
software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of
agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial
variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system
that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure
(CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies
including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness
between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8%
mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for
evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware
design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

Abstract: This report presents a taxonomy and examples of potential omnicidal events
resulting from AI: scenarios where all or almost all humans are killed. These
events are not presented as inevitable, but as possibilities that we can work
to avoid. Insofar as large institutions require a degree of public support in
order to take certain actions, we hope that by presenting these possibilities
in public, we can help to support preventive measures against catastrophic
risks from AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EduFlow是一个端到端框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在科学任务中的推理能力，通过EduPRM奖励模型和EduMCTS搜索框架优化多步推理和自校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在科学任务中表现不佳，尤其是在需要多步和可解释推理的场景中，缺乏全局一致性和自校正能力。

Method: 提出EduFlow框架，包括EduPRM奖励模型（基于课程学习训练）和EduMCTS搜索框架（引入自校正机制和引导搜索）。

Result: 实验表明EduFlow显著提升了推理的一致性和连贯性，并构建了EduMCTS-160K数据集。

Conclusion: EduFlow为科学教育中的复杂推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，代码、数据和模型将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific
tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning.
Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of
global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective
self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We
introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline
of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based
trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core
is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with
tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three
complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected
critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to
multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We
further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces
bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as
a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It
further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward
higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and
rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of
educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models
will be released.

Motivation: 可解释性和适应性是下一代AI系统的关键，尤其是在大型语言模型（LLMs）和生成式AI中。研究旨在结合这两种特性，设计可迁移且可解释的神经符号AI系统。

Method: 研究聚焦于Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation系统，通过系统评估不同知识表示（结构和复杂性）对LLM查询三元组存储的影响。

Result: 结果显示，知识表示的结构和复杂性对LLM查询三元组存储的效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了知识表示在AI系统中的重要性，为设计更高效、可解释的神经符号AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and
next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true
in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly,
generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or
scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are
particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is,
investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI
systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and
query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper,
we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations
of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in
this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our
results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss
their impact and implications.

TL;DR: LLM-Stackelberg游戏框架将大语言模型（LLM）融入领导者与追随者的战略互动中，通过结构化提示和概率行为生成，定义了两类均衡概念，并在钓鱼攻击案例中验证了其认知丰富性和对抗潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Stackelberg博弈假设完全信息和理性代理，而现实中的决策往往涉及有限理性和信息不对称。本文旨在通过LLM扩展博弈框架，以更贴近实际场景。

Method: 提出LLM-Stackelberg游戏框架，代理通过结构化提示推理、生成概率行为，并定义推理均衡和行为均衡两类概念。

Result: 通过钓鱼攻击案例验证了框架的有效性，展示了LLM在战略互动中的认知和对抗潜力。

Conclusion: LLM-Stackelberg游戏为网络安全、错误信息和推荐系统等领域的决策建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential
decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into
strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from
classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents,
our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts,
generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through
internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts:
reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal
prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning
equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized
models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded
rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We
illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and
a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This
example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of
LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide
a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as
cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出从反应式到主动式多智能体强化学习的范式转变，利用生成式AI实现前瞻性决策和协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多智能体强化学习中面临指数级增长的动作空间、非平稳环境和部分可观测性等挑战，无法应对新场景。

Method: 通过生成式AI重构智能体为生成模型，预测环境演变和其他智能体行为，生成协调动作序列，实现战略推理。

Result: 生成式强化学习智能体能够进行前瞻性决策、增强协作通信，并动态适应环境变化。

Conclusion: 这一范式转变有望解决传统框架下难以处理的协作问题，推动分布式智能和集体协作行为的发展。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that
conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint
action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates
moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current
methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when
facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from
reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based
reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as
isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of
synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions
based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than
responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model
environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated
action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term
dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation
capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless
coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving
scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented
possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual
optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine
collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems,
robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination
challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在规划中计算成本高，CTP旨在通过单步生成解决这一问题。

Method: 利用一致性轨迹模型（CTM）进行高效轨迹优化，支持单步轨迹生成。

Result: 在D4RL测试中表现优异，性能接近且速度提升120倍。

Conclusion: CTP是一种高效、低延迟的离线规划方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline
model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed
Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While
prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong
performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative
sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation
without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL
benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based
planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves
higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In
particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup
in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for
high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Metropolis-Hastings采样的框架，用于训练SNN在RL任务中，无需依赖梯度方法，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在RL任务中因脉冲通信的不可微性导致训练困难，需要一种替代梯度的方法。

Method: 采用Metropolis-Hastings采样，基于累积奖励信号迭代更新网络参数，绕过反向传播的限制。

Result: 在AcroBot和CartPole基准测试中，该方法在累积奖励和资源效率上优于传统DQL和SNN-RL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为SNN在RL任务中的训练提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient
alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control
systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of
spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our
knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling,
a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL
environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach
iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates
based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations
of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic
platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks:
AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach
outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL
approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing
network resources and training episodes.

  To evaluate the system, we conduct two experiments. First, a retrieval
benchmark on legal corpora reveals that a chunk size of 512 tokens yields the
highest retrieval precision (Top-3 accuracy: 91.3%). Second, a generation
quality test using TRACe metrics across five LLMs shows that eSapiens delivers
more context-consistent outputs with up to a 23% improvement in factual
alignment.
  These results demonstrate the effectiveness of eSapiens in enabling
trustworthy, auditable AI workflows for high-stakes domains like legal and
finance.

Motivation: AI的快速扩张带来了被忽视的环境和伦理问题，需要系统性地探讨这些问题以推动负责任的AI发展。

Method: 通过综合近期研究和机构报告，分析了AI在能源消耗、电子废物、计算资源不平等和网络安全能源需求方面的系统性影响。

Result: 揭示了AI模型训练的高排放、硬件快速更新、全球基础设施不均衡以及网络安全能源负担等问题。

Conclusion: AI的发展需与伦理责任和环境保护相结合，倡导可持续、透明和公平的发展实践，以实现更具包容性和可持续性的技术未来。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent years,
yet its rapid expansion brings overlooked environmental and ethical challenges.
This review explores four critical areas where AI's impact extends beyond
performance: energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste), inequality in
compute access, and the hidden energy burden of cybersecurity systems. Drawing
from recent studies and institutional reports, the paper highlights systemic
issues such as high emissions from model training, rising hardware turnover,
global infrastructure disparities, and the energy demands of securing AI. By
connecting these concerns, the review contributes to Responsible AI discourse
by identifying key research gaps and advocating for sustainable, transparent,
and equitable development practices. Ultimately, it argues that AI's progress
must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship to ensure
a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.

Conclusion: 神经符号框架有效提升机器人互操作性，集成策略对生成符合本体的知识图谱至关重要。

Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic
environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance.
These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1
and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our
findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,
highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating
ontology-compliant KGs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems often interact with multiple agents. The
regulation of such AI systems often requires that {\em a priori\/} guarantees
of fairness and robustness be satisfied. With stochastic models of agents'
responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees
require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here,
we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic
control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties
of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a
closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these
interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity
associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of
multi-agent systems.

Result: 总结了当前研究进展，提出了优化LRMs推理效率的潜在方向。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了该领域的全面概览，旨在启发新的自适应推理方法，以更好地利用LRMs。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have
demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics
and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences
(slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models
(fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge
that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for
trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference
resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the
practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is
crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning
between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive
thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks,
and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers
quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive
thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果关系的深度Q网络（Causal DQ）方法，用于部分可观测的传感器布局优化，以快速检测异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源限制，无法在所有位置部署传感器，现有方法多忽略因果关系或依赖不切实际的干预手段。

Method: 通过在每个Q网络训练阶段整合因果信息，提出Causal DQ方法。

Result: 该方法收敛更快，理论误差更小，显著减少了异常检测时间。

Conclusion: Causal DQ不仅适用于传感器布局，还可推广到其他强化学习问题，为工程应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume
of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due
to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to
detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal
sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system
while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider
only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,
although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on
interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which
is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we
introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for
partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating
causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves
faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the
trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for
anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor
placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current
implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various
reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world
causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法的可行性，使用了多个短事实性基准数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号推理提供了一个理论框架，既能利用LLM的知识，又能保持逻辑的可靠性和完备性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with
logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs'
broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their
inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the
interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We
provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating
the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality
benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for
neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the
underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Result: 微调后的模型表现优于更大的模型，但非推理模型或人工标注的CoT数据效果较差。

Conclusion: 高质量的专家CoT数据难以复制，但少量精心设计的人工CoT数据仍能有效激活基础模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in
diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning
traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like
DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without
fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be
induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20
long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly
fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms
the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of
high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further
explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced
with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,
neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that
certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze
key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and
answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,
we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small
quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our
human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further
investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and
classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of
large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous
classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be
integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose
reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded
symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and
grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within
this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning
approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and
reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive
reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the
effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning
reliability.

Result: 专业验证器准确性高但召回率低，通用模型包容性强但精度不稳定，验证器对输入结构敏感且跨领域泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 验证器技术存在瓶颈，需进一步优化以提升可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL)
to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge
is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference
answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.
Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based
verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM
judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building
better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'
performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable
development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address
this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for
systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions
covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is
equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the
evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a
multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental
framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized
verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.
complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers
fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve
leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show
stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover
verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in
cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks
of current verifier technology.

TL;DR: HAPPO算法通过独立学习实现单调改进，但部分参数共享（ParPS）导致策略更新基线漂移。OMDPG算法引入最优边际Q函数和广义Q批评器，解决了冲突，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构多智能体强化学习中单调改进与部分参数共享（ParPS）之间的冲突。

Method: 提出OMDPG算法，使用最优边际Q函数替代顺序计算的Q函数，引入广义Q批评器，并采用CCGA架构。

Result: 在SMAC和MAMuJoCo环境中，OMDPG优于现有MARL基线。

Conclusion: OMDPG成功解决了单调改进与ParPS的冲突，提升了异构MARL的性能。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

Method: 利用Promise Theory的语义时空模型，通过多尺度异常检测和过程一致性分析数据的意图和背景。

Result: 提供了一种低计算成本、无需大规模训练或推理的潜在意图评估方法，适用于基础生物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解数据的潜在意图提供了一种实用且高效的工具，但概念形成水平受限于代理的记忆能力。

Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of
philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in
science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the
scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective
Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low
level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence
as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent
`intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and
assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort
parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime
coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation
of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference
to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the
reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial
probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends,
however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning
capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the
accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel
approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's
intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head
activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based
on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of
each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically
selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and
Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and
commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in
both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on
large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning
models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction
ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement
path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)
can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG)

later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG
interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on
SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first
align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100
DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic
KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures
and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs
were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find
that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies,
and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations
for DBpedia to Wikidata.

Result: 实验表明，提出的渐进ABA语义满足平衡性和单调性等理想性质，并与基于论证的方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 本文填补了ABA框架中渐进语义的空白，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained
alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a
dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of
acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,
bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,
to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this
has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it
being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications
where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and
propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which
are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do
so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of
(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular
gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy
suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as
balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that
leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.
Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our
gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess
convergence.

Motivation: 随着AI系统的能力增强和普及，确保其安全性变得至关重要，但现有工具无法单独提供全面保障，需要集成方法。

Method: 提出了BlueGlass框架，支持整合和组合多样化的安全工具，覆盖模型内部和输出。

Result: 通过三个安全分析展示了框架的实用性，包括分布评估、层级动态分析和稀疏自编码器识别可解释概念。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更稳健可靠的AI系统提供了基础性基础设施和发现。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety
of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target
different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in
isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This
paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI
safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration
and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and
outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present
three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object
detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and
potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer
dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and
(3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this
work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more
robust and reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost
effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration

selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud
application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH)
problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and
analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand
available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in
emerging computing continuum environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用人类心理学中的元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）来减少LLMs的偏见，展示了这种方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs仍在发展中，当前的偏见可能随时间变化，因此需要通用的去偏见策略。人类决策中的去偏见方法为LLMs提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 采用元认知提示（如“你可能是错的吗？”）引导LLMs反思其回答，揭示潜在的偏见和矛盾。

Result: 元认知提示能有效引导LLMs识别自身偏见、错误和矛盾信息，这些在初始回答中未体现。

Conclusion: 人类心理学为LLMs的提示工程提供了新思路，借鉴了人类决策改进的有效方法。

Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,
what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies
for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for
debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they
incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge
into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of
information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and
contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if
prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making
literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show
promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?"
Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional
information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,
contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their
initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and
users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a
set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including
implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be
wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent
metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing
but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive
prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for
prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based
improvements to human decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在野火监测中至关重要，但现有深度强化学习方法（DRL）存在采样效率低、仿真与现实的差距等问题，不适合时间敏感的应用。

Method: FRSICL利用自然语言任务描述和环境反馈，动态生成数据收集调度和飞行控制，无需大量重新训练。

Result: 仿真结果表明，FRSICL在最小化AoI方面优于PPO和最近邻基线方法。

Conclusion: FRSICL是一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，适用于无人机辅助的实时监测任务。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界多智能体系统（MAS）的复杂性和动态性限制了MARL的实际部署，需要算法在持续变化的系统配置和操作需求下保持有效性。

Method: 引入适应性概念，提出包含三个维度的结构化框架：学习适应性、策略适应性和场景驱动适应性。

Result: 通过适应性视角，支持对MARL性能的更原则性评估，超越狭窄定义的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于开发更适合动态现实世界多智能体系统的MARL算法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in
coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained
scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS)
remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such
environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of
variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and
inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL
algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations
and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for
adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and
practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL
algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the
environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on
the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three
key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven
adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more
principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks.
Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are
better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了瑞士食品知识图谱（SwissFKG），整合了食谱、成分、替代品、营养数据、饮食限制和过敏原信息，并利用LLM增强图谱内容，为下一代饮食评估工具奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动饮食评估系统忽视非视觉因素（如成分替代对营养的影响）和个性化需求（如过敏、文化习惯）。瑞士缺乏整合这些信息的中心化资源。

Method: 构建SwissFKG，采用LLM增强图谱内容，并评估四种LLM在食品知识增强中的表现。开发Graph-RAG应用展示图谱如何支持LLM回答营养查询。

Result: LLM能有效丰富图谱的营养信息。SwissFKG提供成分级信息（如过敏原）和营养指南支持，优于传统食谱推荐。

Conclusion: SwissFKG结合视觉、上下文和文化维度，为下一代饮食评估工具提供了基础。

Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through
multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic
dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as
recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter
nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including
allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In
Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains
fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant
nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we
introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our
best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with
nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national
nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment
pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first
benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge
augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the
graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe
recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and
dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional
guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the
SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer
user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by
comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,
our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment
tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DT在稀疏奖励环境中的适用性，并验证FBC是否更优。

Method: 在Robomimic和D4RL任务上实验，比较FBC和DT的性能。FBC通过过滤低质量轨迹后进行行为克隆。

Result: FBC在稀疏奖励环境中表现优于DT，且更高效。

Conclusion: DT在稀疏奖励环境中并非优选，甚至可能在其他环境中也不占优，引发对其适用性的质疑。

Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis
tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design
recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI
assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,
cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and
comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified
the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,
and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should
specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to
illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study
guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's
ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can
help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant
to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory
results regarding XAI design.

Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable
Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze
and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the
Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and
real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide
actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency
of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how
the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of
our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward
to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for
instance analysis in the CVRP field.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early
detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance.
Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely
researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning
platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources,
including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to
accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model
that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic
and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We
fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were
then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in
XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year,
achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model.
Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics,
such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in
developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage
student perseverance

Conclusion: 提出的方法在数据稀缺领域高效获取先验知识，为相关应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks
stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and
computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,
where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream
tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of
task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,
due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational
models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational
immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our
work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of
priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we
demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on
non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that
our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire
more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model
Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene
generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a
handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We
then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel
scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed
scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a
pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,
addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

*Tarek Berghout*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Recurrent Expansion (RE)的新学习范式，超越了传统的机器学习和深度学习，通过分析模型自身的行为演化实现自我迭代改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习仅关注静态数据表示，而RE通过引入模型行为演化的维度，旨在实现更智能、自适应的学习系统。

Method: RE通过多次映射数据到相同深度架构中，并结合内部表示（如特征图）和性能信号（如损失）进行分析。进一步扩展为Multiverse RE (MVRE)和Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE)，后者引入多样化架构模型。

Result: RE框架实现了行为感知、自我演化的学习系统，为智能模型提供了新的理论基础。

Conclusion: RE标志着深度学习从纯表示学习转向行为感知的自进化系统，为可扩展、自适应的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces Recurrent Expansion (RE) as a new learning paradigm
that advances beyond conventional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).
While DL focuses on learning from static data representations, RE proposes an
additional dimension: learning from the evolving behavior of models themselves.
RE emphasizes multiple mappings of data through identical deep architectures
and analyzes their internal representations (i.e., feature maps) in conjunction
with observed performance signals such as loss. By incorporating these
behavioral traces, RE enables iterative self-improvement, allowing each model
version to gain insight from its predecessors. The framework is extended
through Multiverse RE (MVRE), which aggregates signals from parallel model
instances, and further through Heterogeneous MVRE (HMVRE), where models of
varying architectures contribute diverse perspectives. A scalable and adaptive
variant, Sc-HMVRE, introduces selective mechanisms and scale diversity for
real-world deployment. Altogether, RE presents a shift in DL: from purely
representational learning to behavior-aware, self-evolving systems. It lays the
groundwork for a new class of intelligent models capable of reasoning over
their own learning dynamics, offering a path toward scalable, introspective,
and adaptive artificial intelligence. A simple code example to support
beginners in running their own experiments is provided in Code Availability
Section of this paper.

Result: 在VGG16和AlexNet模型上测试，该方法在比特错误率为10-4时，显著提升了AlexNet的可靠性（60%以上），且开销与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 基于XAI的TMR方法能有效提升DNN的可靠性，同时控制开销。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains,
where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of
bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is
applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest
contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection
criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an
efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip
faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can
provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and
weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection
metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost,
gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to
enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being
protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16
and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate
that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4,
achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead
as state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Farmers in developing regions like Karnataka, India, face a dual challenge:
navigating extreme market and climate volatility while being excluded from the
digital revolution due to literacy barriers. This paper presents a novel
decision support system that addresses both challenges through a unique
synthesis of machine learning and human-computer interaction. We propose a
hybrid recommendation engine that integrates two predictive models: a Random
Forest classifier to assess agronomic suitability based on soil, climate, and
real-time weather data, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to forecast
market prices for agronomically viable crops. This integrated approach shifts
the paradigm from "what can grow?" to "what is most profitable to grow?",
providing a significant advantage in mitigating economic risk. The system is
delivered through an end-to-end, voice-based interface in the local Kannada
language, leveraging fine-tuned speech recognition and high-fidelity speech
synthesis models to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users. Our results
show that the Random Forest model achieves 98.5% accuracy in suitability
prediction, while the LSTM model forecasts harvest-time prices with a low
margin of error. By providing data-driven, economically optimized
recommendations through an inclusive interface, this work offers a scalable and
impactful solution to enhance the financial resilience of marginalized farming
communities.

Motivation: LoRA在不同模型架构和训练设置下速度提升不一致，作者希望探究其性能限制因素并提出改进方法。

Method: 对LoRA性能进行全面分析，提出更高效的微调方法，并进行实证评估。

Result: 提出的方法在性能上可比或优于LoRA，同时提供更一致的训练速度提升。

Conclusion: 本文为资源受限下优化大语言模型微调提供了有价值的见解和实用指南。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of
trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of
parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory
consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However,
we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across
all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the
underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose
several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate
these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach
achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent
training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical
guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource
constraints.

Result: 模型实现了物理一致的预测，能够处理非线性动态并满足边界和初始条件，展示了在高性能科学计算环境（Julia语言）中的可扩展性和灵活性。

Conclusion: PINN框架为污染物扩散模拟提供了一种优于传统求解器的可扩展且灵活的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional numerical methods often struggle with the complexity and scale of
modeling pollutant transport across vast and dynamic oceanic domains. This
paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to simulate
the dispersion of pollutants governed by the 2D advection-diffusion equation.
The model achieves physically consistent predictions by embedding physical laws
and fitting to noisy synthetic data, generated via a finite difference method
(FDM), directly into the neural network training process. This approach
addresses challenges such as non-linear dynamics and the enforcement of
boundary and initial conditions. Synthetic data sets, augmented with varying
noise levels, are used to capture real-world variability. The training
incorporates a hybrid loss function including PDE residuals, boundary/initial
condition conformity, and a weighted data fit term. The approach takes
advantage of the Julia language scientific computing ecosystem for
high-performance simulations, offering a scalable and flexible alternative to
traditional solvers

Motivation: 解决传统基于规则或LSTM的洗钱检测方法在泛化能力和假阳性率控制上的不足。

Method: 1. 通过对比学习无监督学习时间序列表示；2. 利用这些表示生成洗钱评分；3. 采用双阈值和BH程序控制假阳性率。

Result: Transformer能有效捕捉洗钱模式，检测能力优于规则或LSTM方法，同时控制假阳性率。

Conclusion: 新方法在洗钱检测中表现出更高的泛化能力和假阳性控制能力。

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new
procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both
qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The
first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series
through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages
these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all
observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a
controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)
procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general
representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with
minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability
of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while
keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with
rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models
(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The
intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the
current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization
step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to
potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the
denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that
reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single
approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on
widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL
methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers
additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer
function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with
the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),
position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying
RL to dLLMs reasoning.

Motivation: 路易体病（LBD）是一种常见但研究不足的痴呆症，数据稀缺限制了深度学习的效果。AD数据丰富，但LBD和AD数据因采集方式和协议不同存在领域偏移。

Method: 使用结构MRI提取的结构连接性（SC）作为训练数据，通过TAT自适应分配权重，增强疾病可转移特征，抑制领域特异性特征。

Result: 实验证明TAT有效减少了领域偏移，提高了LBD诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 这是首个在数据稀缺和领域偏移条件下探索AD到LBD领域适应的研究，为罕见疾病的领域自适应诊断提供了框架。

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that
imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal
cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD
diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In
contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge
transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites
using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift.
To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a
Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to
enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived
from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT
adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while
suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving
diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity
and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis
of rare diseases.

Result: WRCor及其投票代理在评估和架构搜索中表现优于现有方法，能在4 GPU小时内发现ImageNet-1k上测试误差22.1%的架构。

Conclusion: WRCor是一种高效、稳定的零-shot NAS代理方法，显著提升了架构搜索的效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically
designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of
NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training
multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods
use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their
effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel
training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor).
WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different
input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which
can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on
proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more
efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with
different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on
architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most
existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can
discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset
within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at

Motivation: 联邦推荐系统（FedRecs）存在通信开销高和训练效率低的问题，现有压缩方法导致模型性能下降。

Method: 采用动作共享策略，将梯度聚类为有限的动作进行通信，而非直接压缩嵌入矩阵，并引入自适应聚类机制。

Result: 实验表明，FedRAS能减少通信负载达96.88%，且不影响推荐性能。

Conclusion: FedRAS有效解决了通信开销和训练效率问题，适用于异构设备和网络环境。

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated
Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender
systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from
two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive
item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low
training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network
environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ
various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the
parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from
model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,
this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,
which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item
embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication
rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud
server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since
gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining
the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors
compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.
To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS
incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the
number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate
that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,
while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous
scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at

Conclusion: DAFOS为大规模GNN训练提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from
graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout
settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we
propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel
approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and
prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node
scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally
important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses.
DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when
performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets,
ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a
state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv
dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score
from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the
ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of
DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

Result: 以轮式车辆避障任务为例，展示了AMLAS-RL框架的有效性。

Conclusion: AMLAS-RL为RL系统提供了一种系统性安全保障方法，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing
integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS
offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant
safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning
(RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex,
dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and
environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in
safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective
but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating
safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic
assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured
guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does
not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we
adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an
RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate
AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a
target goal without collision.

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series
forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the
available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the
performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods,
including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal
prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First,
when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized
prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive
accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are
used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced
these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data
for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation
models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series
applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce
the experiments is available.

Conclusion: e-Profits为业务决策提供了更直观、财务驱动的模型评估工具。

Abstract: Retention campaigns in customer relationship management often rely on churn
prediction models evaluated using traditional metrics such as AUC and F1-score.
However, these metrics fail to reflect financial outcomes and may mislead
strategic decisions. We introduce e-Profits, a novel business-aligned
evaluation metric that quantifies model performance based on customer-specific
value, retention probability, and intervention costs. Unlike existing
profit-based metrics such as Expected Maximum Profit, which assume fixed
population-level parameters, e-Profits uses Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to
estimate personalised retention rates and supports granular, per customer
evaluation. We benchmark six classifiers across two telecom datasets (IBM Telco
and Maven Telecom) and demonstrate that e-Profits reshapes model rankings
compared to traditional metrics, revealing financial advantages in models
previously overlooked by AUC or F1-score. The metric also enables segment-level
insight into which models maximise return on investment for high-value
customers. e-Profits is designed as an understandable, post hoc tool to support
model evaluation in business contexts, particularly for marketing and analytics
teams prioritising profit-driven decisions. All source code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了图神经网络（GNN）在求解偏微分方程（PDE）时所需消息传递迭代次数的严格下界，显著减少了超参数调优的需求。


<details>

Motivation: 通过将问题的物理特性与GNN的消息传递需求联系起来，减少对超参数调优的依赖，提高求解效率。

Method: 针对三类基本PDE（双曲型、抛物型和椭圆型），通过分析物理常数、时空离散化与GNN消息传递机制的关系，推导出迭代次数的下界。

Result: 当迭代次数低于下界时，信息无法有效传播，导致解质量差；满足下界时，GNN能准确捕捉现象学，得到高精度解。

Conclusion: 通过四个方程实例验证了下界的严格性，表明该方法能有效指导GNN在PDE求解中的应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes sharp lower bounds for the number of message passing
iterations required in graph neural networks (GNNs) when solving partial
differential equations (PDE). This significantly reduces the need for
exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. Bounds are derived for the three fundamental
classes of PDEs (hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic) by relating the physical
characteristics of the problem in question to the message-passing requirement
of GNNs. In particular, we investigate the relationship between the physical
constants of the equations governing the problem, the spatial and temporal
discretisation and the message passing mechanisms in GNNs.
  When the number of message passing iterations is below these proposed limits,
information does not propagate efficiently through the network, resulting in
poor solutions, even for deep GNN architectures. In contrast, when the
suggested lower bound is satisfied, the GNN parameterisation allows the model
to accurately capture the underlying phenomenology, resulting in solvers of
adequate accuracy.
  Examples are provided for four different examples of equations that show the
sharpness of the proposed lower bounds.

Abstract: Undesirable biases encoded in the data are key drivers of algorithmic
discrimination. Their importance is widely recognized in the algorithmic
fairness literature, as well as legislation and standards on
anti-discrimination in AI. Despite this recognition, data biases remain
understudied, hindering the development of computational best practices for
their detection and mitigation. In this work, we present three common data
biases and study their individual and joint effect on algorithmic
discrimination across a variety of datasets, models, and fairness measures. We
find that underrepresentation of vulnerable populations in training sets is
less conducive to discrimination than conventionally affirmed, while
combinations of proxies and label bias can be far more critical. Consequently,
we develop dedicated mechanisms to detect specific types of bias, and combine
them into a preliminary construct we refer to as the Data Bias Profile (DBP).
This initial formulation serves as a proof of concept for how different bias
signals can be systematically documented. Through a case study with popular
fairness datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DBP in predicting
the risk of discriminatory outcomes and the utility of fairness-enhancing
interventions. Overall, this article bridges algorithmic fairness research and
anti-discrimination policy through a data-centric lens.

Abstract: The field of AI research is advancing at an unprecedented pace, enabling
automated hypothesis generation and experimental design across diverse domains
such as biology, mathematics, and artificial intelligence. Despite these
advancements, there remains a significant gap in the availability of scalable
advising systems capable of providing high-quality, well-reasoned feedback to
refine proposed hypotheses and experimental designs. To address this challenge,
we explore key factors that underlie the development of robust advising
systems, including model size, context length, confidence estimation, and
structured reasoning processes. Our findings reveal that a relatively small
model, when equipped with a well-compressed literature database and a
structured reasoning framework, can outperform powerful general-purpose
language models such as Deepseek-R1 in terms of acceptance rates for
self-ranked top-30% submissions to ICLR 2025. Moreover, when limited to
high-confidence predictions, our system achieves an acceptance rate exceeding
90% on the ICLR 2025 test set, underscoring its potential to significantly
enhance the quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation and experimental
design. The code is released at

### [64] [Next-Generation Travel Demand Modeling with a Generative Framework for Household Activity Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08871)
*Xishun Liao,Haoxuan Ma,Yifan Liu,Yuxiang Wei,Brian Yueshuai He,Chris Stanford,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的旅行需求建模框架，通过整合人口合成、活动生成、位置分配和大规模微观交通模拟，实现了数据驱动、可扩展且可迁移的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于活动的模型（ABMs）依赖简化规则和假设，开发成本高且难以跨区域适应。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 框架整合了人口合成、协调活动生成、位置分配和大规模微观交通模拟，形成一个统一系统。

Result: 模型在洛杉矶的1000万人口中验证，与真实世界移动模式高度吻合，性能接近传统ABMs，但成本更低、可扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 该框架为旅行需求建模提供了一种高效、可扩展且可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility
system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in
behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are
costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper
presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes
household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's
socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population
synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and
large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully
generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A
full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million
population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates
real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with
significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to
the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine
similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network
yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans
PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001
JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法收敛速度提升40%，累计奖励比软行动者-评论家方法高4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了语义通信中的噪声和资源限制问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model
based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural
network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and
decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model
based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a
transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural
network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for
follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.
Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework
over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the
CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic
information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP
model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize
semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay
and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a
proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus
finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that
our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the
accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Motivation: 现有AI模型在脑电图识别中存在评分者间差异、资源限制和泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在脑疾病诊断和治疗中的应用。

Method: 研究使用两个独立数据集（2006-2020年）开发和验证VIPEEGNet模型，开发队列包含1950名患者的106,800个EEG片段，测试队列包含1532名患者的EEG片段。

Result: VIPEEGNet在二分类和多分类任务中表现出高准确率（AUROC 0.930-0.972），性能接近人类专家，且参数效率高（仅使用排名第一算法的2.8%参数）。

Conclusion: VIPEEGNet是一种高效且泛化能力强的模型，有望推动脑电图在脑疾病诊断和治疗中的实际应用。

Abstract: Timely identification of harmful brain activities via electroencephalography
(EEG) is critical for brain disease diagnosis and treatment, which remains
limited application due to inter-rater variability, resource constraints, and
poor generalizability of existing artificial intelligence (AI) models. In this
study, a convolutional neural network model, VIPEEGNet, was developed and
validated using EEGs recorded from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard
Medical School. The VIPEEGNet was developed and validated using two independent
datasets, collected between 2006 and 2020. The development cohort included EEG
recordings from 1950 patients, with 106,800 EEG segments annotated by at least
one experts (ranging from 1 to 28). The online testing cohort consisted of EEG
segments from a subset of an additional 1,532 patients, each annotated by at
least 10 experts. For the development cohort (n=1950), the VIPEEGNet achieved
high accuracy, with an AUROC for binary classification of seizure, LPD, GPD,
LRDA, GRDA, and "other" categories at 0.972 (95% CI, 0.957-0.988), 0.962 (95%
CI, 0.954-0.970), 0.972 (95% CI, 0.960-0.984), 0.938 (95% CI, 0.917-0.959),
0.949 (95% CI, 0.941-0.957), and 0.930 (95% CI, 0.926-0.935). For multi
classification, the sensitivity of VIPEEGNET for the six categories ranges from
36.8% to 88.2% and the precision ranges from 55.6% to 80.4%, and performance
similar to human experts. Notably, the external validation showed
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD)of 0.223 and 0.273, ranking top 2 among the
existing 2,767 competing algorithms, while we only used 2.8% of the parameters
of the first-ranked algorithm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ODIA的新方法，通过在线用户交互数据加速LLM的函数调用，显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM函数调用的高延迟影响用户体验，需要一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Method: 利用生产流量中的简单查询，通过知识蒸馏将大模型的能力迁移到小模型上。

Result: 响应延迟降低45%（预期）和78%（中位数），小模型能处理60%流量且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ODIA是一种无需人工干预、持续优化的实用解决方案，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high
latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user
experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation
for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to
accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from
production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones,
our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while
maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model
successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method
requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated
data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for
production environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）采样的深度神经网络（DNN）概率最后一层方法（LL-HMC），以降低计算成本并应用于大规模数据集。通过比较五种概率深度学习方法，LL-HMC在分类和异常检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMC虽为不确定性估计的金标准，但其计算成本限制了在大规模DNN中的应用。LL-HMC通过仅对最后一层进行HMC采样，降低了计算需求。

Method: LL-HMC将HMC采样限制在DNN的最后一层，减少了计算量。论文在三个真实视频数据集上比较了LL-HMC与其他五种概率深度学习方法。

Result: LL-HMC在分布内分类和异常检测中表现优异，但额外的采样参数仅对异常检测有提升，多链或起始位置未带来一致改进。

Conclusion: LL-HMC是一种高效的概率最后一层方法，适用于计算资源有限的场景，尤其在异常检测方面表现突出。

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a
probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is
widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the
computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large
DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can
be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number
of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the
required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a
DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited
computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last
layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world
video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution
classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we
performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant
on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results
show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD
detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve
the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple
chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测方法虽然性能高，但存在对种族和性别等人口属性的偏见，威胁公众信任。

Method: 采用Fair-FLIP方法，通过重新加权训练模型的最后一层输入，减少子群体差异。

Result: 实验显示，Fair-FLIP将公平性指标提升30%，同时基线准确率仅下降0.25%。

Conclusion: Fair-FLIP能有效减少偏见，且对检测性能影响极小。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular,
yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to
public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high
predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes
such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair
deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust
detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing
approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising
(Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce
subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting
highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the
baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches
show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining
baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

TL;DR: 论文研究了无需Lipschitz平滑假设的随机洗牌梯度方法的收敛性，提出了新的步长策略，证明了其在非凸、强凸和非强凸情况下的收敛速率，并通过实验验证了其实际效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机洗牌梯度方法的收敛性分析大多依赖Lipschitz平滑条件，而许多机器学习模型不满足此条件，因此需要研究更弱的假设下的收敛性。

Method: 提出了一种新的步长策略，分析了随机洗牌梯度方法在非凸、强凸和非强凸情况下的收敛速率，适用于随机洗牌和任意洗牌方案。

Result: 在不假设Lipschitz平滑的条件下，算法不仅收敛，且收敛速率与当前已知最优速率一致。数值实验验证了其实际性能。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了随机洗牌梯度方法的适用范围，为实际应用提供了更灵活的理论支持。

Abstract: Shuffling-type gradient methods are favored in practice for their simplicity
and rapid empirical performance. Despite extensive development of convergence
guarantees under various assumptions in recent years, most require the
Lipschitz smoothness condition, which is often not met in common machine
learning models. We highlight this issue with specific counterexamples. To
address this gap, we revisit the convergence rates of shuffling-type gradient
methods without assuming Lipschitz smoothness. Using our stepsize strategy, the
shuffling-type gradient algorithm not only converges under weaker assumptions
but also match the current best-known convergence rates, thereby broadening its
applicability. We prove the convergence rates for nonconvex, strongly convex,
and non-strongly convex cases, each under both random reshuffling and arbitrary
shuffling schemes, under a general bounded variance condition. Numerical
experiments further validate the performance of our shuffling-type gradient
algorithm, underscoring its practical efficacy.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖分数匹配，但存在效率问题。本文探索反向离散化和近端映射的潜力，以提升生成模型的性能。

Method: 通过近端匹配学习对数密度的近端算子，并开发ProxDM模型。理论证明其仅需较少的采样步骤即可生成高精度分布。

Result: 理论分析显示ProxDM在KL散度下仅需$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$步即可生成$\varepsilon$-精确分布。实验表明其收敛速度显著快于传统方法。

Conclusion: ProxDM通过反向离散化和近端映射，在理论和实际中均优于传统分数匹配方法，为高效生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful
generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their
development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the
log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data
distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased
estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative,
backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the
score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results
in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with
them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that
$\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting
discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL
divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve
significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to
conventional score-matching methods.

Conclusion: 通过调整超参数，模型在异构数据中的适应性和鲁棒性得到进一步提升。

Abstract: In order to improve the accuracy of cross-platform advertisement
recommendation, a graph neural network (GNN)- based advertisement
recommendation method is analyzed. Through multi-dimensional modeling, user
behavior data (e.g., click frequency, active duration) reveal temporal patterns
of interest evolution, ad content (e.g., type, tag, duration) influences
semantic preferences, and platform features (e.g., device type, usage context)
shape the environment where interest transitions occur. These factors jointly
enable the GNN to capture the latent pathways of user interest migration across
platforms. The experimental results are based on the datasets of three
platforms, and Platform B reaches 0.937 in AUC value, which is the best
performance. Platform A and Platform C showed a slight decrease in precision
and recall with uneven distribution of ad labels. By adjusting the
hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size and embedding dimension, the
adaptability and robustness of the model in heterogeneous data are further
improved.

Result: 实验证明新方法在ImageNet和QM9数据集上有效提升了样本质量。

Conclusion: 新方法通过简单修改解决了现有CFG实现的问题，显著提升了离散扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional
generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and
recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically
analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role
of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling
(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage
guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation
for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The
analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These
implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as
unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the
quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the
analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically
applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the
transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)
distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method
is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is
empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete
diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery
and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate
predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data.
In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy
perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive
for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,
the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on
a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha
(ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with
binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against
experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping
ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further
benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind
model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding
energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of
DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the
computational cost.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems
in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive
at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a
radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical
equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free
solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully
simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly
learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional
computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic
innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and
advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning
chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence
problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics
including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our
results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic
systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that
transcends traditional computational limitations.

Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses
mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are
pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter
regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across
scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved
state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly
tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield
prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological
forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also
accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social
networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as
estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods
even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution,
a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs
retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most
similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active.
This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening --
not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep
learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming
simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision,
enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more
effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already
shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those
of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a
systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion
models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with
their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and
how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical
insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation
alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target
representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different
synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal
pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances
representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image,
protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior
performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the
class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in
$23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times
speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at

Abstract: While poisoning attacks on machine learning models have been extensively
studied, the mechanisms by which adversaries can distribute poisoned models at
scale remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we shed light on how model
leaderboards -- ranked platforms for model discovery and evaluation -- can
serve as a powerful channel for adversaries for stealthy large-scale
distribution of poisoned models. We present TrojanClimb, a general framework
that enables injection of malicious behaviors while maintaining competitive
leaderboard performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four diverse
modalities: text-embedding, text-generation, text-to-speech and text-to-image,
showing that adversaries can successfully achieve high leaderboard rankings
while embedding arbitrary harmful functionalities, from backdoors to bias
injection. Our findings reveal a significant vulnerability in the machine
learning ecosystem, highlighting the urgent need to redesign leaderboard
evaluation mechanisms to detect and filter malicious (e.g., poisoned) models,
while exposing broader security implications for the machine learning community
regarding the risks of adopting models from unverified sources.

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts
meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG),
Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on
data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting
embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation
was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code
is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The
projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across
modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident
cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were
predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals
added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with
the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance,
achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across
different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the
external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed
framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data.
The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into
clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models with

and (2) gaze-based distribution of sparse rewards at token level. Our
experiments demonstate that gaze-informed RLHF achieves faster convergence
while maintaining or slightly improving performance, thus, reducing
computational costs during policy optimization. These results show that human
gaze provides a valuable and underused signal for policy optimization, pointing
to a promising direction for improving RLHF efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has
yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis
reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental
flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true
performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a
comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring
anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,
and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM
inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode
operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict
temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common
anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate
engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to
represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial
performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.
To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from
our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these
anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the
practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing
speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is
easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these
anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation
methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,
and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving
beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Method: 训练小型结构化子网络，避免节点间激活通信，采用两种子网络构建策略。

Result: 随机块丢弃技术表现优于宽度子网络构建，内存使用减少20-40%且性能无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少内存需求的同时保持性能，具有潜力。

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory
demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication
costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory
requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate
workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation
communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or
lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We
evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of
ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed
training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique
consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously
explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior
performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks
having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our
approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in
performance.

Motivation: 混杂变量会导致虚假相关性和预测偏差，现有方法（如MDN）在持续学习中难以有效处理。

Method: 引入R-MDN层，通过递归最小二乘法动态调整特征表示，适应数据和混杂变量的变化。

Result: 实验表明，R-MDN在静态和持续学习中均能减少混杂变量的影响，避免灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: R-MDN是一种有效的工具，可在持续学习中实现混杂变量不变的特征表示。

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the
target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are
recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models,
such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned
features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of
continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time
without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to
confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from
intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN)
layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including
vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical
regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and
continually update an internal model state with respect to changing
distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate
that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within
static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing
catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

Conclusion: 行为探索方法成功实现了快速在线适应和专家式探索，为自主代理提供了更高效的学习能力。

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents that quickly explore an environment and adapt
their behavior online is a canonical challenge in robotics and machine
learning. While humans are able to achieve such fast online exploration and
adaptation, often acquiring new information and skills in only a handful of
interactions, existing algorithmic approaches tend to rely on random
exploration and slow, gradient-based behavior updates. How can we endow
autonomous agents with such capabilities on par with humans? Taking inspiration
from recent progress on both in-context learning and large-scale behavioral
cloning, in this work we propose behavioral exploration: training agents to
internalize what it means to explore and adapt in-context over the space of
``expert'' behaviors. To achieve this, given access to a dataset of expert
demonstrations, we train a long-context generative model to predict expert
actions conditioned on a context of past observations and a measure of how
``exploratory'' the expert's behaviors are relative to this context. This
enables the model to not only mimic the behavior of an expert, but also, by
feeding its past history of interactions into its context, to select different
expert behaviors than what have been previously selected, thereby allowing for
fast online adaptation and targeted, ``expert-like'' exploration. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both simulated locomotion and
manipulation settings, as well as on real-world robotic manipulation tasks,
illustrating its ability to learn adaptive, exploratory behavior.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种数据模态下显著提升了样本质量和计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在不牺牲性能的前提下，有效提高了GPGMs的生成效率。

Abstract: Gaussian-based Probabilistic Generative Models (GPGMs) generate data by
reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with
Gaussian noise. While these models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their practical deployment remains constrained by the
high computational cost of long generative trajectories, which often involve
hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we
introduce a theoretically grounded and empirically validated framework that
improves generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or
inference fidelity. Our key insight is that for certain data modalities, the
noising process causes data to rapidly lose its identity and converge toward a
Gaussian distribution. We analytically identify a characteristic step at which
the data has acquired sufficient Gaussianity, and then replace the remaining
generation trajectory with a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike
existing acceleration techniques that coarsening the trajectories by skipping
steps, our method preserves the full resolution of learning dynamics while
avoiding redundant stochastic perturbations between `Gaussian-like'
distributions. Empirical results across multiple data modalities demonstrate
substantial improvements in both sample quality and computational efficiency.

Method: 提出了两种干预措施：在开环稳定系统中使用动作分块（预测并执行动作序列），在不稳定系统中使用噪声注入（在专家演示中添加噪声）。

Result: 这些干预措施有效缓解了复合误差问题，并与现代机器人学习中的流行选择一致，但其效果与设计目标不同。

Conclusion: 研究结合了控制理论和强化学习的工具，揭示了单独考虑任一领域时未自然出现的新问题。

Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a continuous
state-and-action dynamical system. While imitation learning in discrete
settings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and
popularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous
driving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the
compounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform
stably. Recent work has demonstrated that even in benign settings, exponential
compounding errors are unavoidable when learning solely from expert-controlled
trajectories, suggesting the need for more advanced policy parameterizations or
data augmentation. To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably
mitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.
When the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe "action chunking," i.e.,
predicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is
possibly unstable, we prescribe "noise injection," i.e., adding noise during
expert demonstrations. These interventions align with popular choices in modern
robot learning, though the benefits we derive are distinct from the effects
they were designed to target. Our results draw insights and tools from both
control theory and reinforcement learning; however, our analysis reveals novel
considerations that do not naturally arise when either literature is considered
in isolation.

Result: 研究结果表明，DPO不仅适用于现有场景，还能自然扩展到包括边际和长度校正等新设置。

Conclusion: 从通用理论视角理解DPO有助于优化其应用，并避免偏离理论框架的潜在问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing
major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience
and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise
and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to
as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from
the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM
(Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927
and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the
EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an
effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed
model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks

Motivation: 现有半梯度TD方法简单高效但易发散，而GTD方法虽有收敛保证但多用于线性近似。本文旨在扩展GTD方法至非线性多步场景。

Result: 在MuJoCo和MinAtar环境中，新方法优于PPO和StreamQ。

Conclusion: 多步GTD方法在深度强化学习中表现出更高的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning
(RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient
temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are
consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like
Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely
been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman
Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear
function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods,
which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In
this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit
assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based
methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view
formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation
compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and
MinAtar environments, respectively. Code available at

both the PCA and ICA problems in the continuous setting through a contrast
function term in the network loss, enforcing the desired statistical properties
of the source signals (decorrelation, independence) learned in the
decomposition. This extension to a continuous domain allows the application of
such decompositions to point clouds and irregularly sampled signals where
standard techniques are not applicable.

Motivation: 多模态融合（MMF）依赖严格的时间同步，但网络延迟可能导致时间错位，影响感知任务。

Method: 提出DejaVu攻击，分析传感器对任务的不平衡敏感性；设计AION防御，通过跨模态时间一致性监测攻击。

Result: 攻击可显著降低感知任务性能（如检测mAP降88.5%）；AION防御的AUROC达0.92-0.98。

Conclusion: DejaVu攻击揭示MMF脆弱性，AION为有效防御方法。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous
driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and
efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal
synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle
temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream
MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different
models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced
sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while
object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a
single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to
88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy
(MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense
patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal
alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal
shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path
of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our
thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with
low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it
as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于集合到集合（S2S）的推荐框架S2SRec2，用于在电商购物篮中推荐互补食材，解决了传统方法无法处理多食材缺失和忽略食材间关系的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电商购物中，顾客常因缺乏专业知识而无法构建完整的食材组合。传统方法仅能预测单一缺失食材，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 提出S2SRec2框架，基于Set Transformer，通过多任务学习联合学习缺失食材检索和购物篮完整性评估。

Result: 实验表明，S2SRec2显著优于单目标基线方法，提升了购物体验和烹饪创意。

Conclusion: S2SRec2为电商食材推荐提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In grocery e-commerce, customers often build ingredient baskets guided by
dietary preferences but lack the expertise to create complete meals. Leveraging
recipe knowledge to recommend complementary ingredients based on a partial
basket is essential for improving the culinary experience. Traditional recipe
completion methods typically predict a single missing ingredient using a
leave-one-out strategy. However, they fall short in two key aspects: (i) they
do not reflect real-world scenarios where multiple ingredients are often
needed, and (ii) they overlook relationships among the missing ingredients
themselves. To address these limitations, we reformulate basket completion as a
set-to-set (S2S) recommendation problem, where an incomplete basket is input
into a system that predicts a set of complementary ingredients. We introduce
S2SRec2, a set-to-set ingredient recommendation framework based on a Set
Transformer and trained in a multitask learning paradigm. S2SRec2 jointly
learns to (i) retrieve missing ingredients from the representation of existing
ones and (ii) assess basket completeness after prediction. These tasks are
optimized together, enforcing accurate retrieval and coherent basket
completion. Experiments on large-scale recipe datasets and qualitative analyses
show that S2SRec2 significantly outperforms single-target baselines, offering a
promising approach to enhance grocery shopping and inspire culinary creativity.

TL;DR: 本文研究了特征选项（eigenoptions）在模型无关强化学习（RL）中加速信用分配的作用，发现预定义特征选项有助于探索和信用分配，而在线发现可能阻碍学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索特征选项在强化学习中的信用分配作用，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 在表格和像素网格世界中评估特征选项，并提出一种在非线性函数逼近下学习选项值的方法。

Result: 预定义特征选项有助于探索和信用分配，但在线发现可能因偏置经验而阻碍学习。

Conclusion: 特征选项在支持信用分配和探索方面具有潜力，但也存在复杂性。

Abstract: Options, which impose an inductive bias toward temporal and hierarchical
structure, offer a powerful framework for reinforcement learning (RL). While
effective in sequential decision-making, they are often handcrafted rather than
learned. Among approaches for discovering options, eigenoptions have shown
strong performance in exploration, but their role in credit assignment remains
underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether eigenoptions can
accelerate credit assignment in model-free RL, evaluating them in tabular and
pixel-based gridworlds. We find that pre-specified eigenoptions aid not only
exploration but also credit assignment, whereas online discovery can bias the
agent's experience too strongly and hinder learning. In the context of deep RL,
we also propose a method for learning option-values under non-linear function
approximation, highlighting the impact of termination conditions on
performance. Our findings reveal both the promise and complexity of using
eigenoptions, and options more broadly, to simultaneously support credit
assignment and exploration in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合图提示与权重剪枝的新框架GPAWP，旨在通过减少提示数量提升图神经网络的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在图任务中表现优异，但仍面临训练时间长、难以捕捉复杂关系等问题。图预训练和提示方法虽受关注，但忽略了图提示的优化潜力及其对模型稳定性的影响。

Method: 提出GPAWP框架，结合图提示与权重剪枝，通过重要性评估函数筛选正负提示，并采用分层剪枝去除负提示。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPAWP显著减少了节点分类任务的参数量，同时保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: GPAWP通过优化图提示，提升了GNN的效率和性能，为图任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their
triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times,
difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature
extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods
have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale
datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential
improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the
potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both
positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with
weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and
efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance
of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive
and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically
structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more
parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a
significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POIFormer是一种基于Transformer的框架，用于准确高效地将用户访问归因于特定POI，解决了GPS不准确和POI密集的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GPS精度问题和城市环境中POI的高密度分布，传统的基于邻近性的方法无法准确归因用户访问。

Method: POIFormer利用Transformer的自注意力机制，联合建模空间邻近性、访问时间、POI语义、用户行为和群体行为模式等多维度信号。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，POIFormer在空间噪声和POI密集的环境中显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: POIFormer是一种实用且高效的POI归因方法，适用于多种数据源和地理环境。

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a
foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and
urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS
inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and
the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues
can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius
in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient
for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce
\textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and
efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited
spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly
models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and
duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from
user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's
self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these
dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future
visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral
patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate,
efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture
supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts
while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it
practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world
mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines,
particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise
and dense POI clustering.

Motivation: 现有图方法独立处理药物对，忽略复杂上下文依赖的相互作用，且难以整合生物网络和分子结构。

Method: MolecBioNet将药物对建模为统一实体，提取生物知识图谱子图和分子表示，使用图神经网络学习多尺度表示，并引入两种池化策略（CASPool和AGIPool）及互信息最小化正则化。

Conclusion: MolecBioNet通过统一建模和多尺度整合，提供了更准确和可解释的DDI预测。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology,
often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for
patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved
strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently,
overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs.
Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction
networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic
insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework
that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable
DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet
captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular
influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework
extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs
hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging
classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of
drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces
two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling
(CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and
attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential
molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information
minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding
fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and
embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair
modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于在线世界模型的持续强化学习方法（OA），通过模型预测控制解决任务序列，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续强化学习中，智能体在学习新任务时容易遗忘旧任务（灾难性遗忘），需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用在线学习的世界模型（Follow-The-Leader浅层模型）进行规划，结合模型预测控制解决任务序列。

Result: 实验表明，OA能持续学习新任务且不遗忘旧技能，性能优于基于深度世界模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在线世界模型和规划方法有效解决了持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where
an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks
that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that
the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task,
known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this
challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a
Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which
we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any
reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by
construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$
under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest
online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally.
To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for
CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning
algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously
to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built
on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Motivation: 传统AI天气预测模型依赖数值天气预报系统准备初始条件，耗时且效率低，XiChen旨在实现完全独立的AI驱动预测。

Method: 基于预训练的天气预测基础模型，通过微调实现数据同化和观测操作，结合四维变分知识提升精度。

Result: XiChen的预测准确性与传统系统相当，且预测领先时间超过8.25天。

Conclusion: XiChen展示了完全脱离数值天气预报系统的AI驱动天气预测的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant
potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models
rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition
preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce
XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather
forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to
medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is
built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting.
Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation
operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw
satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional
variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting
accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful
forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that
XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting
independent of NWP systems.

TL;DR: DeepX-GAN模型用于模拟超出历史记录的极端气候事件，揭示潜在风险，并强调空间依赖性和适应性政策的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候极端事件记录不完整，忽视了超出历史范围的“未见”极端事件和空间依赖性，低估了同步灾害的风险。

Method: 开发DeepX-GAN（一种知识驱动的深度生成模型），用于捕捉罕见极端事件的空间结构，并模拟统计上合理的“未见”极端事件。

Result: 在MENA地区应用发现，“未见”极端事件对脆弱区域影响更大；未来变暖可能重新分布这些事件，形成新的热点区域。

Conclusion: 需制定空间适应性政策，以应对新兴风险热点，而非仅依赖历史模式。

Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk,
missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel,
neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that
amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN
(Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial
Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture
the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of
DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical
experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen
extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate"
extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in
fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked.
Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous
complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes
disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic
readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could
expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots
in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights
critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need
to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots
rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“warm-start model”的确定性模型，通过提供更好的起始点显著加速条件生成，减少了生成过程所需的步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的迭代生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配）生成高质量样本需要大量计算步骤，效率低下。

Method: 引入warm-start模型，通过预测条件化的先验分布N(mu, sigma)作为起始点，减少生成过程的距离。

Result: 在图像修复等任务中，仅需11次函数评估即可达到与1000步DDPM基线竞争的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且兼容现有生成模型，可与其他高效采样技术结合，进一步提升生成速度。

Abstract: Iterative generative models, like diffusion and flow-matching, create
high-fidelity samples by progressively refining a noise vector into data.
However, this process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function
evaluations. We introduce the warm-start model, a simple, deterministic model
that dramatically accelerates conditional generation by providing a better
starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed N(0, I)
prior, our warm-start model predicts an informed prior N(mu, sigma), whose
moments are conditioned on the input context. This "warm start" substantially
reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, particularly when
the conditioning information is strongly informative. On tasks like image
inpainting, our method achieves results competitive with a 1000-step DDPM
baseline using only 11 total function evaluations (1 for the warm start, 10 for
generation). A simple conditional normalization trick makes our method
compatible with any standard generative model and sampler without modification,
allowing it to be combined with other efficient sampling techniques for further
acceleration. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/jonas-scholz123/warm-start-model.

Abstract: Wavelet neural network (WNN), which learns an unknown nonlinear mapping from
the data, has been widely used in signal processing, and time-series analysis.
However, challenges in constructing accurate wavelet bases and high
computational costs limit their application. This study introduces a
constructive WNN that selects initial bases and trains functions by introducing
new bases for predefined accuracy while reducing computational costs. For the
first time, we analyze the frequency of unknown nonlinear functions and select
appropriate initial wavelets based on their primary frequency components by
estimating the energy of the spatial frequency component. This leads to a novel
constructive framework consisting of a frequency estimator and a wavelet-basis
increase mechanism to prioritize high-energy bases, significantly improving
computational efficiency. The theoretical foundation defines the necessary
time-frequency range for high-dimensional wavelets at a given accuracy. The
framework's versatility is demonstrated through four examples: estimating
unknown static mappings from offline data, combining two offline datasets,
identifying time-varying mappings from time-series data, and capturing
nonlinear dependencies in real time-series data. These examples showcase the
framework's broad applicability and practicality. All the code will be released
at https://github.com/dshuangdd/CWNN.

Result: 实验表明，TPP-SD在合成和真实数据集上均能生成与标准方法相同的分布样本，且速度提升2-6倍。

Conclusion: TPP-SD填补了强大Transformer TPP模型与实际快速采样需求之间的差距。

Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal
point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques
from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between
thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we
develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to
generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger
target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as
autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces
samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$
speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as
draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the
gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid
sequence sampling.

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major
limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two
lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator
(CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size
control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy
loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch
artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks.
Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach
improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based
PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across
architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling

Result: 在多个EHR数据集上实验表明，选择性插补减少了误差并提升了24小时死亡率预测任务的表现。

Conclusion: 将不确定性纳入时间序列插补具有实际价值，能显著提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains.
Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor
disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is
critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack
mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general
framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation.
By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable
imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering
diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing
less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves
downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour
mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating
uncertainty into time series imputation.

Abstract: An autoencoder (AE) is a neural network that, using self-supervised training,
learns a succinct parameterized representation, and a corresponding encoding
and decoding process, for all instances in a given class. Here, we introduce
the concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of
autoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the
values of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the
family is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated
encoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general
concept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the
defining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are
dynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim
report we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the
motivating research directions in machine learning and biology.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations
between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations.
As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention.
However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream
classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA
method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are
independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without
compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world
data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating
its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving
fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in
neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then
learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph
neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting
their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce
\textit{Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks} (NCGNs), a class of graph neural
networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise
level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as
noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant
neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions.
Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific
instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message
passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise-independent
architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds,
spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究了多头潜在注意力（MLA）在预训练中对Transformer内部容量的影响，发现旋转嵌入的应用方式对防止容量瓶颈至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多头潜在注意力（MLA）对Transformer预训练中内部容量的影响，特别是旋转嵌入的应用方式。

Method: 使用Marchenko-Pastur（MP）诊断分析$W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$矩阵的频谱，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA-PreRoPE和MLA-Decoupled三种变体。

Result: 发现容量瓶颈局部出现，导致表达性集中在狭窄子空间；仅MLA-Decoupled能防止这一现象，保持广泛的频谱支持。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入的应用方式与压缩位置同样重要，共享旋转组件可避免频谱碎片化并保持容量。

Abstract: In this work, we study how multi-head latent attention (MLA), a popular
strategy for compressing key/value memory, affects a transformer's internal
capacity during pretraining. Using a lightweight suite of Marchenko-Pastur (MP)
diagnostics, we analyze the spectrum of the $W_{Q}W_{K}^\top$ gram matrix
throughout training, comparing three variants: the standard multi-head
attention (MHA) baseline, MLA-PreRoPE with rotary applied before compression,
and MLA-Decoupled, which shares a single rotary sub-vector across all heads.
Our random matrix analysis reveals \textbf{three key findings:} \textbf{ i)}
capacity bottlenecks emerge locally: both MHA and MLA-PreRoPE exhibit sharp,
early spikes in specific layers that persist and propagate, disrupting the
balance between bulk and outlier directions; \textbf{ ii)} these spikes
coincide with rank collapse, concentrating the model's expressivity into narrow
subspaces; \textbf{ iii)} only the decoupled variant prevents this cascade,
maintaining broad spectral support and suppressing outlier formation across
layers. These results underscore that \emph{how} rotary embeddings are applied
is just as critical as \emph{where} compression occurs. Sharing rotary
components across heads mitigates spectral fragmentation and preserves
representational capacity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于缩放定律的系统方法，用于确定目标领域的最优数据混合比例，避免了传统试错法的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据混合比例选择依赖试错法，在大规模预训练中不切实际，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用缩放定律预测模型在不同数据混合比例下的损失，并通过小规模训练估计参数，外推至更大规模和未见过的数据混合。

Result: 在LLM、NMM和LVM三种大规模预训练场景中验证了缩放定律的普适性和预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化数据混合比例提供了理论支持，显著降低了预训练成本。

Abstract: Large foundation models are typically trained on data from multiple domains,
with the data mixture--the proportion of each domain used--playing a critical
role in model performance. The standard approach to selecting this mixture
relies on trial and error, which becomes impractical for large-scale
pretraining. We propose a systematic method to determine the optimal data
mixture for any target domain using scaling laws. Our approach accurately
predicts the loss of a model of size $N$ trained with $D$ tokens and a specific
domain weight vector $h$. We validate the universality of these scaling laws by
demonstrating their predictive power in three distinct and large-scale
settings: large language model (LLM), native multimodal model (NMM), and large
vision models (LVM) pretraining. We further show that these scaling laws can
extrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be
accurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to
estimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The
scaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain
under a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to
costly trial-and-error methods.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全对齐后仍可能表现出欺骗行为，需要一种机制来检测和缓解此类问题。

Method: 采用对抗性激活修补技术，通过将欺骗性提示的激活修补到安全前向传递中，模拟漏洞并量化欺骗率。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI安全提供了新工具，并提出了未来研究方向，如多模态场景下的扩展和伦理考量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent
deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit
critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a
novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching
as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in
transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and
patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate
vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network
simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we
demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from
a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We
propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation
in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review
synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial
attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust
fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research
directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use
potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型参数过多导致资源受限设备部署困难的问题。

Method: 应用信息几何分析模型压缩方法，提出迭代奇异值阈值方法。

Result: 改进现有方法，通过软秩减少在固定压缩率下提升性能。

Conclusion: 信息几何视角为模型压缩提供新思路，迭代方法在压缩与性能间取得平衡。

Abstract: The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate
effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained
devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study
of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods
within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator
factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge:
defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it.
We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as
implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We
highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information
divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this
may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios,
trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for
achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation,
necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove
convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural
networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility
of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods
through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed
compression rates.

Motivation: 多元时间序列中的因果关系理解对金融和营销等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以处理复杂依赖和滞后效应。

Method: DyCAST-Net结合扩张时间卷积和多尺度时间依赖捕获，通过动态稀疏注意力机制消除虚假连接，并使用统计洗牌测试验证提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在金融和营销数据集上，DyCAST-Net优于现有模型（如TCDF、GCFormer和CausalFormer），能更精确估计因果延迟并减少误发现。

Conclusion: DyCAST-Net通过可解释的注意力热图揭示隐藏因果模式，适用于高维动态环境，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is
essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and
marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional
analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal
Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel
architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated
temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net
effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated
convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its
attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy
and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens
robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference
reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets
demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as
TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation
of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in
noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights,
uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising
on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial
markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent
mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in
high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by
RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability
across diverse application domains

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大模型在上下文学习（ICL）中的工作机制，尤其是其泛化能力和实现方式。

Method: 通过合成线性回归任务和分布外泛化实验，分析模型行为；利用谱分析研究预训练语料对ICL的影响。

Result: 模型在分布外数据上泛化能力差，且其行为与OLS等算法不一致；谱分析显示训练数据分布具有独特谱特征。

Conclusion: ICL的机制并非简单实现传统学习算法，而是受预训练语料分布影响，泛化能力有限。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example
input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success,
the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study
synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at
inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the
performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers
through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments
that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt
distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers
implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the
pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the
learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same
distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique
spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two
singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution
inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly
correlated with low loss.

Abstract: Proactive maintenance strategies, such as Predictive Maintenance (PdM), play
an important role in the operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), particularly
due to their capacity to reduce offline time by preventing unexpected shutdowns
caused by component failures.
  In this work, we explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture combined with a computational thermomechanical model to calculate
the temperature, stress, and strain of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel
rod during operation. This estimation relies on a limited number of temperature
measurements from the cladding's outer surface. This methodology can
potentially aid in developing PdM tools for nuclear reactors by enabling
real-time monitoring of such systems.
  The training, validation, and testing datasets were generated through coupled
simulations involving BISON, a finite element-based nuclear fuel performance
code, and the MOOSE Thermal-Hydraulics Module (MOOSE-THM). We conducted eleven
simulations, varying the peak linear heat generation rates. Of these, eight
were used for training, two for validation, and one for testing.
  The CNN was trained for over 1,000 epochs without signs of overfitting,
achieving highly accurate temperature distribution predictions. These were then
used in a thermomechanical model to determine the stress and strain
distribution within the fuel rod.

Result: 在多样化的真实数据集上验证了FBM在长短期预测任务中的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FBM方法有效解决了现有傅里叶方法的局限性，并通过时频特征提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for
time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis
functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the
frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine
basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing
Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series
length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and
overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping
(FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features
through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our
approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal
characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of
neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better
performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear,
MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model
architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and
interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model
time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several
techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking,
centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale
down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for
both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic
assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address
this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of
decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with
continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model
paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental
fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and
ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort
homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with
transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32
contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting
the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention
interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models
(mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns,
outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though
linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models
(mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity
profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting
patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation,
while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories
suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and
pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific
homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS
progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor
monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment
in future multi-center studies.

Conclusion: La-Proteina展示了在高达800个残基的蛋白质设计任务中的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为全原子结构条件下的蛋白质设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recently, many generative models for de novo protein structure design have
emerged. Yet, only few tackle the difficult task of directly generating fully
atomistic structures jointly with the underlying amino acid sequence. This is
challenging, for instance, because the model must reason over side chains that
change in length during generation. We introduce La-Proteina for atomistic
protein design based on a novel partially latent protein representation: coarse
backbone structure is modeled explicitly, while sequence and atomistic details
are captured via per-residue latent variables of fixed dimensionality, thereby
effectively side-stepping challenges of explicit side-chain representations.
Flow matching in this partially latent space then models the joint distribution
over sequences and full-atom structures. La-Proteina achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple generation benchmarks, including all-atom
co-designability, diversity, and structural validity, as confirmed through
detailed structural analyses and evaluations. Notably, La-Proteina also
surpasses previous models in atomistic motif scaffolding performance, unlocking
critical atomistic structure-conditioned protein design tasks. Moreover,
La-Proteina is able to generate co-designable proteins of up to 800 residues, a
regime where most baselines collapse and fail to produce valid samples,
demonstrating La-Proteina's scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation,
such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential
equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in
visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and
thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete
situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to
estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using
the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our
method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number
of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing
equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating
the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds
for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating
tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the
two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative
calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative
estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function
representation. Consequently, our technique offers broad applicability across
domains such as vision representation, feature extraction, fluid mechanics, and
cross-media imaging.

Result: AV学习方法在控制任务中优于Q学习；RDQ在MinAtar基准测试中显著优于Dueling DQN。

Conclusion: AV学习方法在控制任务中更具优势，新算法RDQ表现优异。

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping:
using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of
TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single
action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less
attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value
functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in
learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as
either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been
investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is
advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether
such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze
these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We
find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the
prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over
Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning
algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly
outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Abstract: The usage of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods has become
essential in practical applications, given the increasing deployment of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and the legislative requirements put
forward in the latest years. A fundamental but often underestimated aspect of
the explanations is their robustness, a key property that should be satisfied
in order to trust the explanations. In this study, we provide some preliminary
insights on evaluating the reliability of explanations in the specific case of
unbalanced datasets, which are very frequent in high-risk use-cases, but at the
same time considerably challenging for both AI models and XAI methods. We
propose a simple evaluation focused on the minority class (i.e. the less
frequent one) that leverages on-manifold generation of neighbours, explanation
aggregation and a metric to test explanation consistency. We present a use-case
based on a tabular dataset with numerical features focusing on the occurrence

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DRAGD的新型攻击方法，利用联邦学习中遗忘前后的梯度差异重构被删除的数据，并进一步提出了改进版DRAGDP。实验表明，这两种方法在数据重构方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的遗忘机制可能通过梯度交换泄露敏感信息，研究旨在揭示这一隐私漏洞并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出DRAGD攻击方法，利用梯度差异重构数据；改进为DRAGDP，结合公开数据提高重构精度。

Result: DRAGD和DRAGDP在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂数据（如面部图像）上表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦遗忘中的隐私漏洞，并提出了实际解决方案，推动了联邦遗忘系统的安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving
data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow
clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy
concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process
can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce
DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after
unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced
version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve
reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and
DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our
work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and
offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning
systems in real-world applications.

TL;DR: LoRA-MCL通过结合多选择学习和低秩适应，提升语言模型生成多样且合理句子延续的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型在处理上下文时无法有效应对多义性问题，LoRA-MCL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多选择学习（MCL）和Winner-Takes-All损失，结合低秩适应（LoRA）处理模糊性。

Result: 在视觉和音频字幕任务中，模型生成的结果具有高多样性和相关性。

Conclusion: LoRA-MCL为语言模型提供了一种有效处理多义性的方法，生成结果更丰富且合理。

Abstract: We propose LoRA-MCL, a training scheme that extends next-token prediction in
language models with a method designed to decode diverse, plausible sentence
continuations at inference time. Traditional language modeling is an
intrinsically ill-posed problem: given a context, multiple futures may be
equally plausible. Our approach leverages Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) and
the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to efficiently handle ambiguity through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We provide a theoretical interpretation of applying
Multiple Choice Learning to Language Modeling, assuming the data is generated
from a mixture of distributions. To illustrate the proposed approach, we use
data sampled from mixtures of Markov chains. We then demonstrate with extensive
experiments on real-world visual and audio captioning tasks that our method
achieves high diversity and relevance in generated outputs.

TL;DR: MLoRQ是一种结合低秩近似和混合精度量化的新方法，用于在资源受限的边缘设备上部署Transformer网络，通过两阶段优化实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署Transformer网络面临资源限制的挑战，现有技术如低秩近似和量化各有局限，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: MLoRQ采用两阶段优化：层内优化筛选压缩方案，层间优化分配位宽和秩；可选步骤通过自适应舍入减少误差。

Result: MLoRQ在视觉Transformer任务中表现优异，性能提升高达15%。

Conclusion: MLoRQ为边缘设备上的Transformer部署提供了一种高效且兼容性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying transformer-based neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices presents a significant challenge. This challenge is often addressed
through various techniques, such as low-rank approximation and mixed-precision
quantization. In this work, we introduce Mixed Low-Rank and Quantization
(MLoRQ), a novel method that integrates both techniques. MLoRQ employs a
two-stage optimization process to determine optimal bit-width and rank
assignments for each layer, adhering to predefined memory constraints. This
process includes: (i) an intra-layer optimization that identifies potentially
optimal compression solutions out of all low-rank and quantization
combinations; (ii) an inter-layer optimization that assigns bit-width precision
and rank to each layer while ensuring the memory constraint is met. An optional
final step applies a sequential optimization process using a modified adaptive
rounding technique to mitigate compression-induced errors in joint low-rank
approximation and quantization. The method is compatible and can be seamlessly
integrated with most existing quantization algorithms. MLoRQ shows
state-of-the-art results with up to 15\% performance improvement, evaluated on
Vision Transformers for image classification, object detection, and instance
segmentation tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 研究如何让大型语言模型（LLM）服务于具有不同文化、政治等冲突偏好的用户。

Method: 通过大规模人类研究分析偏好差异，提出负相关采样方法，并构建多语言多轮偏好数据集。

Result: 人类偏好比LLM响应更多样化；负相关采样显著提升对齐方法性能；开源了最大的多语言偏好数据集。

Conclusion: Community Alignment数据集有望提升LLM对全球多样化用户的服务效果。

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences
that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance
this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate,
through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from
five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in
preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show
that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for
learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient
dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity
of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for
negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that
simple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the
performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,
based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source
Community Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and
multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons
from annotators spanning five countries. We hope that the Community Alignment
dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for
a diverse global population.

Motivation: 探讨强化学习对LLMs推理能力的影响，并揭示Qwen2.5模型在基准测试中可能存在的不可靠性。

Method: 引入生成器创建合成算术问题数据集RandomCalculation，用于评估RL方法的有效性。

Result: 在无污染数据集上，仅准确奖励信号能提升性能，而噪声或错误信号无效。

Conclusion: 建议在无污染基准和多样化模型家族上评估RL方法，以确保结论的可信度。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been a
longstanding focus of research. Recent works have further enhanced these
capabilities using reinforcement learning (RL), with many new methods claiming
significant improvements with minimal or no external supervision. Surprisingly,
some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance
reasoning performance. However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the
Qwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,
AMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like
Llama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although
Qwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on
large-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular
benchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be
unreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully
synthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a
clean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we
show that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while
noisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on
uncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure
trustworthy conclusions.

TL;DR: 研究了将Conformal Prediction（CP）与确定性加密数据的监督学习结合，以在隐私保护机器学习中实现不确定性量化。实验表明，CP方法在加密域中仍有效，且e值方法优于p值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补严格不确定性量化与隐私保护机器学习之间的空白。

Method: 使用AES加密的MNIST数据集，测试p值和e值CP方法在加密数据上的表现。

Result: 加密数据上训练的模型仍能提取有意义结构，e值CP覆盖率达60%以上，p值CP覆盖精度较低。

Conclusion: CP在加密数据中有潜力，但需权衡预测集紧凑性与可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised
learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between
rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning.
Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP
methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain,
owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption.
We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal
predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on
deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful
structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random
guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover,
$e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3
loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of
5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive
sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore
critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our
work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure,
privacy-aware learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在DAG中，每个代理只能观察部分特征的情况下，是否可以通过学习顺序和父节点预测实现信息聚合。

Method: 代理按DAG拓扑顺序学习，利用自身观察的特征和父节点预测作为额外特征训练模型。

Result: DAG深度是信息聚合的关键，足够长的路径可实现信息聚合，但某些分布下即使DAG规模大也无法实现。

Conclusion: DAG深度和特征分布决定了信息聚合的可能性，实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We study a distributed learning problem in which learning agents are embedded
in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). There is a fixed and arbitrary distribution
over feature/label pairs, and each agent or vertex in the graph is able to
directly observe only a subset of the features -- potentially a different
subset for every agent. The agents learn sequentially in some order consistent
with a topological sort of the DAG, committing to a model mapping observations
to predictions of the real-valued label. Each agent observes the predictions of
their parents in the DAG, and trains their model using both the features of the
instance that they directly observe, and the predictions of their parents as
additional features. We ask when this process is sufficient to achieve
\emph{information aggregation}, in the sense that some agent in the DAG is able
to learn a model whose error is competitive with the best model that could have
been learned (in some hypothesis class) with direct access to \emph{all}
features, despite the fact that no single agent in the network has such access.
We give upper and lower bounds for this problem for both linear and general
hypothesis classes. Our results identify the \emph{depth} of the DAG as the key
parameter: information aggregation can occur over sufficiently long paths in
the DAG, assuming that all of the relevant features are well represented along
the path, and there are distributions over which information aggregation cannot
occur even in the linear case, and even in arbitrarily large DAGs that do not
have sufficient depth (such as a hub-and-spokes topology in which the spoke
vertices collectively see all the features). We complement our theoretical
results with a comprehensive set of experiments.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了生成式和判别式LSTM文本分类模型在边缘计算中应用时的性能，重点分析了后训练量化（PTQ）对模型的影响，发现生成式模型对量化比特宽度、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算中的文本分类需要低延迟和高精度，生成式分类器对噪声和分布外数据具有鲁棒性，但部署时面临计算和内存限制。PTQ可在不重新训练的情况下减小模型尺寸和计算成本，适合边缘部署。

Method: 使用Brevitas量化库对生成式和判别式LSTM模型进行PTQ，评估不同比特宽度下的性能及其在噪声输入条件下的鲁棒性，并分析校准数据类别不平衡的影响。

Result: 判别式分类器表现稳健，而生成式分类器对量化比特宽度、校准数据和输入噪声更敏感。类别不平衡的校准数据会导致生成式分类器在低比特宽度下性能下降。

Conclusion: 校准数据在PTQ中起关键作用，生成式分类器在噪声条件下的表现受量化参数影响显著，研究为边缘环境中的模型部署提供了指导。

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like
industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low
latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in
particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and
noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such
real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices
faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ)
reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for
edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of
generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text
classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We
evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess
their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while
discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to
bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized
inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for
both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly
distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and
activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from
nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data
during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths
for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This
study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative
classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge
environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing
correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of
kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques,
we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex
mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems.
Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are
extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine
and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand
second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a
sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon
Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these
advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox
(SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable
kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of
various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models
tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible
toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future
applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for

Abstract: Habitats integrate the abiotic conditions and biophysical structures that
support biodiversity and sustain nature's contributions to people. As these
ecosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,
high-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and
restoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial
resolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types
that co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that
complicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote
sensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat
classification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using
vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3
EUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against
independent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical
nature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially
in fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation
models, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.
Finally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted
accuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe
and adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance
temporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and
quality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with
higher-quality in-situ observations.

Conclusion: 该工作标志着从AI加速物理模拟到AI发现物理规律的范式转变，建立了首个真正通用的物理模拟框架。

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation
that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without
requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit
mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their
generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion
transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as
a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the
synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial
relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium
mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential
time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach
bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state
solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our
data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned
representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical
constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics
to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics
simulation framework.

Abstract: Deep generative models are increasingly used for molecular discovery, with
most recent approaches relying on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs)
under the assumption that explicit equivariance is essential for generating
high-quality 3D molecules. However, these models are complex, difficult to
train, and scale poorly.
  We investigate whether non-equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with rotation augmentations can learn equivariance and match the
performance of equivariant models. We derive a loss decomposition that
separates prediction error from equivariance error, and evaluate how model
size, dataset size, and training duration affect performance across denoising,
molecule generation, and property prediction. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to analyze learned equivariance in generative tasks.

Abstract: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) prediction is crucial for
understanding gene regulation and various biological processes. This study
introduces a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach for TFBS prediction,
integrating multiple pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models,
each specializing in different TFBS patterns. We evaluate the performance of
our MoE model against individual expert models on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, using six randomly selected transcription
factors (TFs) for OOD testing. Our results demonstrate that the MoE model
achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse TF binding sites,
particularly excelling in OOD scenarios. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
statistical test confirms the significance of these performance differences.
Additionally, we introduce ShiftSmooth, a novel attribution mapping technique
that provides more robust model interpretability by considering small shifts in
input sequences. Through comprehensive explainability analysis, we show that
ShiftSmooth offers superior attribution for motif discovery and localization
compared to traditional Vanilla Gradient methods. Our work presents an
efficient, generalizable, and interpretable solution for TFBS prediction,
potentially enabling new discoveries in genome biology and advancing our
understanding of transcriptional regulation.

industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based
Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that
combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning.
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional
filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over
time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention
mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically
weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit
(TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module
improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden
representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To
identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents
dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving
generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for
manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong
robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across
three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based single-channel speech separation has
improved considerably, in large part driven by increasingly compute- and
parameter-efficient neural network architectures. Most such architectures are,
however, designed with a fixed compute and parameter budget, and consequently
cannot scale to varying compute demands or resources, which limits their use in
embedded and heterogeneous devices such as mobile phones and hearables. To
enable such use-cases we design a neural network architecture for speech
separation capable of early-exit, and we propose an uncertainty-aware
probabilistic framework to jointly model the clean speech signal and error
variance which we use to derive probabilistic early-exit conditions in terms of
desired signal-to-noise ratios. We evaluate our methods on both speech
separation and enhancement tasks, and we show that a single early-exit model
can be competitive with state-of-the-art models trained at many compute and
parameter budgets. Our framework enables fine-grained dynamic compute-scaling
of speech separation networks while achieving state-of-the-art performance and
interpretable exit conditions.

Abstract: Fast and accurate generation of molecular conformers is desired for
downstream computational chemistry and drug discovery tasks. Currently,
training and sampling state-of-the-art diffusion or flow-based models for
conformer generation require significant computational resources. In this work,
we build upon flow-matching and propose two mechanisms for accelerating
training and inference of generative models for 3D molecular conformer
generation. For fast training, we introduce the SO(3)-Averaged Flow training
objective, which leads to faster convergence to better generation quality
compared to conditional optimal transport flow or Kabsch-aligned flow. We
demonstrate that models trained using SO(3)-Averaged Flow can reach
state-of-the-art conformer generation quality. For fast inference, we show that
the reflow and distillation methods of flow-based models enable few-steps or
even one-step molecular conformer generation with high quality. The training
techniques proposed in this work show a path towards highly efficient molecular
conformer generation with flow-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AMU中保留数据集处理的计算开销大和减少训练轮次的挑战。

Method: 1. Blend：通过视觉相似图像的合并和共享混合权重减少保留集大小；2. A-AMU：通过增强遗忘目标和匹配损失分布加速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了端到端遗忘延迟，同时保持了模型效用和隐私。

Conclusion: 首次通过联合设计专用数据集压缩技术和加速损失函数，系统性提升遗忘效率。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning (AMU) enables models to `forget' specific
training data through specialized fine-tuning on a retained dataset subset.
However, processing this retained subset still dominates computational runtime,
while reductions of epochs also remain a challenge. We propose two
complementary methods to accelerate classification-oriented AMU. First,
\textbf{Blend}, a novel distribution-matching dataset condensation (DC), merges
visually similar images with shared blend-weights to significantly reduce the
retained set size. It operates with minimal pre-processing overhead and is
orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art DC methods. Second, our
loss-centric method, \textbf{Accelerated-AMU (A-AMU)}, augments the unlearning
objective to quicken convergence. A-AMU achieves this by combining a steepened
primary loss to expedite forgetting with a novel, differentiable regularizer
that matches the loss distributions of forgotten and in-distribution unseen
data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual approach of data and
loss-centric optimization dramatically reduces end-to-end unlearning latency
across both single and multi-round scenarios, all while preserving model
utility and privacy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
tackle unlearning efficiency by jointly designing a specialized dataset
condensation technique with a dedicated accelerated loss function. Code is

filter bubbles, and biases affecting candidate-job matching. To address these,
we developed the STAR (Signal Integration for Talent And Recruiters) system,
leveraging the combined strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph

member profiles and job postings, while GNNs capture intricate relationships
and mitigate cold-start issues through network effects. STAR integrates diverse
signals by uniting LLM and GNN capabilities with industrial-scale paradigms
including adaptive sampling and version management. It provides an end-to-end
solution for developing and deploying embeddings in large-scale recommender

embeddings in industrial applications, a scalable GNN-LLM integration for
high-performing recommendations, and practical insights for real-world model
deployment.

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上验证，性能优于标准基线和近期图联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在捕捉空间关系的同时保持了计算效率，为交通预测任务提供了一种有效的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in
specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices
deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an
individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning
(FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing
raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model
updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each
client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging
(FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in
traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are
important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies
during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant
computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL
approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph
learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic
neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting
client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial
relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY,
and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard
baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

Result: 训练过程发现了一种完全密集的解决方案，其效率高于理论构造，且具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络倾向于形成的电路类型，为网络结构和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features
than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for
computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there
has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in
practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND
problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs.
The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is
restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called
compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple
solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully
dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit
naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency.
It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and
extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain
the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the
theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types
of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition
representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network
circuitry and interpretability.

Result: 在低资源场景中显著优于先前方法，在资源丰富场景中仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型兼具DTW的可解释性和神经网络的可训练性，适用于多种时间序列分类任务。

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series
classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for
training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they
lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast,
dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is
widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent
interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and
cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than
neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a
versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with
labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic
length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while
preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the
DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on
this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a
neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available,
while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to
several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it
significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and
remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by
analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial
machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation.
Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive
prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and
extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as
they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally
expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability.
In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that
fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling
inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We
propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative
Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model
(G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional
methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from
response prediction through a well-designed generation process that
incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in
addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$
speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for
cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for
intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems. The code is

Conclusion: 预训练目标应编码任务异质性和时间结构，以优化关系数据库的预测建模。

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of
domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning
from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.
Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks
are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and
SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to
take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.
By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label
generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel
information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a
novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via
set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling
next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an
information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations
retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive
experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms
traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training
objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design
principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

Abstract: An increasing number of NLP applications interact with large language models
(LLMs) through black-box APIs, making prompt engineering critical for
controlling model outputs. While recent Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO)
methods iteratively refine prompts using model-generated feedback, textual
gradients, they primarily focus on error correction and neglect valuable
insights from correct predictions. This limits both their effectiveness and
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel APO framework centered on
enhancing the feedback mechanism. We reinterpret the textual gradient as a form
of negative reinforcement and introduce the complementary positive
reinforcement to explicitly preserve beneficial prompt components identified
through successful predictions. To mitigate the noise inherent in LLM-generated
feedback, we introduce a technique called feedback diversification, which
aggregates multiple feedback signals, emphasizing consistent, actionable advice
while filtering out outliers. Motivated by the rapid evolution and diversity of
available LLMs, we also formalize Continual Prompt Optimization (CPO),
addressing the practical challenge of efficiently migrating optimized prompts
between different model versions or API providers. Our experiments reveal that
naive prompt migration often degrades performance due to loss of critical
instructions. In contrast, our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving significant accuracy improvements, faster convergence, and
lower computational costs in both standard and migration scenarios.

Conclusion: SF方法是一种实用、可扩展且理论支持的语言模型训练方法，解决了传统策略的局限性。

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional
pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate
schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent
alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight
averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay
phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at
the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable
alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],
which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show
that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape
without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable
for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we
conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it
implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this
analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to
momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key
limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model
training.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning
(SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In
contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely
on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large
amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of
evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that
such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To
remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by
adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view,
one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream
tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as
(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream
tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the
variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the
defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we
believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where
downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have
access to.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer a safe and accessible
means of connecting the human brain to external devices, with broad
applications in home and clinical settings to enhance human capabilities.
However, the high noise level and limited task-specific data in non-invasive
signals constrain decoding capabilities. Recently, the adoption of
self-supervised pre-training is transforming the landscape of non-invasive BCI
research, enabling the development of brain foundation models to capture
generic neural representations from large-scale unlabeled
electroencephalography (EEG) signals with substantial noises. However, despite
these advances, the field currently lacks comprehensive, practical and
extensible benchmarks to assess the utility of the public foundation models
across diverse BCI tasks, hindering their widespread adoption. To address this
challenge, we present AdaBrain-Bench, a large-scale standardized benchmark to
systematically evaluate brain foundation models in widespread non-invasive BCI
tasks. AdaBrain-Bench encompasses a diverse collection of representative BCI
decoding datasets spanning 7 key applications. It introduces a streamlined task
adaptation pipeline integrated with multi-dimensional evaluation metrics and a
set of adaptation tools. The benchmark delivers an inclusive framework for
assessing generalizability of brain foundation models across key transfer
settings, including cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot scenarios. We
leverage AdaBrain-Bench to evaluate a suite of publicly available brain
foundation models and offer insights into practices for selecting appropriate
models in various scenarios. We make our benchmark pipeline available to enable
reproducible research and external use, offering a continuously evolving
platform to foster progress toward robust and generalized neural decoding
solutions.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing
heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or
unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings,
resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise
and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG.
TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning
frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their
corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted
or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that
TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across
various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and
achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

Result: 实验表明NeuTSFlow在多种预测任务中具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 从函数族视角出发的NeuTSFlow框架有效提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet
conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their
origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy
observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they
correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can
be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a
shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as
learning the transition from the historical function family to the future
function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we
leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships
between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the
transition path in function space from the historical function family to the
future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a
novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for
learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By
parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function
spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies
at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.
Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior
accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family
perspective.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent
graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks
(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of
high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to
ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph
constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents
challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary
edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of
continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information
loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard
graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,
potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering
outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph
Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately
characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge
weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC
framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative
binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed
soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering
optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that
scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,
cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its
substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our
understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Result: RNN在足够训练后表现出完美无限泛化的相变，并通过隐式表征合并构建了有限自动机。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络从有限训练数据中实现无限泛化的机制，为算法学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable
ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on
generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some
settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the
bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite
generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been
learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop
an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a
simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show
that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase
transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for
the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger
effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that
reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which
neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.

TL;DR: DepBERT结合了依赖树和Transformer模型，优于现有因果关系提取方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有监督方法未充分利用依赖树等语言学工具，限制了因果关系提取的效果。

Method: 提出DepBERT，将句子的依赖树整合到Transformer模型中。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，DepBERT优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DepBERT通过结合依赖树提升了因果关系提取的性能。

Abstract: Extracting cause and effect phrases from a sentence is an important NLP task,
with numerous applications in various domains, including legal, medical,
education, and scientific research. There are many unsupervised and supervised
methods proposed for solving this task. Among these, unsupervised methods
utilize various linguistic tools, including syntactic patterns, dependency
tree, dependency relations, etc. among different sentential units for
extracting the cause and effect phrases. On the other hand, the contemporary
supervised methods use various deep learning based mask language models
equipped with a token classification layer for extracting cause and effect
phrases. Linguistic tools, specifically, dependency tree, which organizes a
sentence into different semantic units have been shown to be very effective for
extracting semantic pairs from a sentence, but existing supervised methods do
not have any provision for utilizing such tools within their model framework.
In this work, we propose DepBERT, which extends a transformer-based model by
incorporating dependency tree of a sentence within the model framework.
Extensive experiments over three datasets show that DepBERT is better than
various state-of-the art supervised causality extraction methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解释大型语言模型（LLM）内部推理过程的新方法，以沸水反应堆系统为例，通过参数高效微调技术（Low-Rank Adaptation）和神经元沉默技术，揭示了模型在核工程领域的知识编码与利用机制。


<details>

Motivation: 在安全关键领域（如核工程）中应用LLM需要理解其内部推理过程，以满足核监管框架（如10 CFR 50 Appendix B）对AI验证与确认的要求。

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术（Low-Rank Adaptation）对通用LLM（Gemma-3-1b-it）进行核领域适配，并通过神经元激活模式比较和神经元沉默技术分析其行为变化。

Result: 研究发现，单独沉默多数特化神经元无显著影响，但集体沉默会导致任务性能显著下降，并损害模型生成详细、上下文准确技术信息的能力。

Conclusion: 本文方法增强了黑盒模型的透明度，为核级AI保障提供了可行路径，解决了安全关键核操作中AI部署的验证与确认挑战。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains,
such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their
internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for
interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a
Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM
(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation
patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a
sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the
adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we
employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while
silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a
statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively
led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative
analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's
ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This
paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an
opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable
neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade
artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and
validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR
50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear
operations.

Motivation: 大语言模型容易记忆重复序列，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法难以有效移除记忆内容。

Method: 提出MemSinks，利用序列标识符激活特定记忆神经元，实现记忆内容的隔离。

Result: 在十亿参数和十亿标记规模下，MemSinks实现了有效隔离和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemSinks首次证明在真实数据上同时实现泛化和隔离是可行的。

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is
achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整神经元数量的方法，以解决类别不平衡问题，提升少数类的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物学启发，人类海马体在学习过程中会持续生成和修剪神经元，表明灵活分配容量可能提升性能。现实数据集中类别不平衡问题常见，固定网络容量会降低少数类识别准确率。

Method: 在训练过程中定期增加和移除神经元，动态调整容量，同时保留多数类学习的关键特征。最终网络大小和结构保持不变。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种代表性模型上的实验表明，该方法优于固定容量网络，且与其他不平衡处理技术结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: 动态、受生物学启发的网络设计能有效提升类别不平衡数据的性能。

Abstract: In conventional deep learning, the number of neurons typically remains fixed
during training. However, insights from biology suggest that the human
hippocampus undergoes continuous neuron generation and pruning of neurons over
the course of learning, implying that a flexible allocation of capacity can
contribute to enhance performance. Real-world datasets often exhibit class
imbalance situations where certain classes have far fewer samples than others,
leading to significantly reduce recognition accuracy for minority classes when
relying on fixed size networks.To address the challenge, we propose a method
that periodically adds and removes neurons during training, thereby boosting
representational power for minority classes. By retaining critical features
learned from majority classes while selectively increasing neurons for
underrepresented classes, our approach dynamically adjusts capacity during
training. Importantly, while the number of neurons changes throughout training,
the final network size and structure remain unchanged, ensuring efficiency and
compatibility with deployment.Furthermore, by experiments on three different
datasets and five representative models, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms fixed size networks and shows even greater accuracy when
combined with other imbalance-handling techniques. Our results underscore the
effectiveness of dynamic, biologically inspired network designs in improving
performance on class-imbalanced data.

Motivation: 在线招聘中职位分类对推荐系统和市场分析至关重要，传统方法因无法充分利用行业类别层次结构而效果有限。

Result: 在大规模职位数据集上验证，模型显著优于现有方法，提高了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为招聘行业提供了更准确的职位分类框架，支持更明智的决策。

Abstract: In the dynamic realm of online recruitment, accurate job classification is
paramount for optimizing job recommendation systems, search rankings, and labor
market analyses. As job markets evolve, the increasing complexity of job titles
and descriptions necessitates sophisticated models that can effectively
leverage intricate relationships within job data. Traditional text
classification methods often fall short, particularly due to their inability to
fully utilize the hierarchical nature of industry categories. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel representation learning and classification
model that embeds jobs and hierarchical industry categories into a latent
embedding space. Our model integrates the Standard Occupational Classification
(SOC) system and an in-house hierarchical taxonomy, Carotene, to capture both
graph and hierarchical relationships, thereby improving classification
accuracy. By embedding hierarchical industry categories into a shared latent
space, we tackle cold start issues and enhance the dynamic matching of
candidates to job opportunities. Extensive experimentation on a large-scale
dataset of job postings demonstrates the model's superior ability to leverage
hierarchical structures and rich semantic features, significantly outperforming
existing methods. This research provides a robust framework for improving job
classification accuracy, supporting more informed decision-making in the
recruitment industry.

Motivation: 推荐系统在潜在空间中具有低秩结构，但如何有效定义和测量距离以捕捉用户和物品关系是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出基于观测矩阵的行和列距离近似潜在空间距离，引入方差校正以处理噪声，并开发了Radial Neighborhood Estimator（RNE）进行邻域平滑。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上评估，RNE优于现有协同过滤和矩阵分解方法，并缓解了冷启动问题。

Conclusion: RNE为潜在空间距离估计提供了新视角，同时提升了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems inherently exhibit a low-rank structure in latent space.
A key challenge is to define meaningful and measurable distances in the latent
space to capture user-user, item-item, user-item relationships effectively. In
this work, we establish that distances in the latent space can be
systematically approximated using row-wise and column-wise distances in the
observed matrix, providing a novel perspective on distance estimation. To
refine the distance estimation, we introduce the correction based on empirical
variance estimator to account for noise-induced non-centrality. The novel
distance estimation enables a more structured approach to constructing
neighborhoods, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which
constructs neighborhoods by including both overlapped and partially overlapped
user-item pairs and employs neighborhood smoothing via localized kernel
regression to improve imputation accuracy. We provide the theoretical
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator. We perform evaluations on both
simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RNE achieves superior
performance compared to existing collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization methods. While our primary focus is on distance estimation in
latent space, we find that RNE also mitigates the ``cold-start'' problem.

Result: 在合成数据集上，改进的GNNWR在捕捉非线性空间关系上优于传统方法，且性能受数据特征影响显著。

Conclusion: 归纳偏差对空间建模至关重要，未来可探索可学习的空间权重函数和混合神经网络架构。

Abstract: Inductive bias is a key factor in spatial regression models, determining how
well a model can learn from limited data and capture spatial patterns. This
work revisits the inductive biases in Geographically Neural Network Weighted
Regression (GNNWR) and identifies limitations in current approaches for
modeling spatial non-stationarity. While GNNWR extends traditional
Geographically Weighted Regression by using neural networks to learn spatial
weighting functions, existing implementations are often restricted by fixed
distance-based schemes and limited inductive bias. We propose to generalize
GNNWR by incorporating concepts from convolutional neural networks, recurrent
neural networks, and transformers, introducing local receptive fields,
sequential context, and self-attention into spatial regression. Through
extensive benchmarking on synthetic spatial datasets with varying
heterogeneity, noise, and sample sizes, we show that GNNWR outperforms classic
methods in capturing nonlinear and complex spatial relationships. Our results
also reveal that model performance depends strongly on data characteristics,
with local models excelling in highly heterogeneous or small-sample scenarios,
and global models performing better with larger, more homogeneous data. These
findings highlight the importance of inductive bias in spatial modeling and
suggest future directions, including learnable spatial weighting functions,
hybrid neural architectures, and improved interpretability for models handling
non-stationary spatial data.

Conclusion: TDCRL通过因果学习机制有效提取域不变特征，显著提升无源域泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions
differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data
from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data
collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable
source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate
visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods
struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the
SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation
to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a
clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,
ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL
effectiveness in SFDG.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently gained significant attention
for solving compliance minimization (CM) problems. However, these methods
typically provide poor feature boundaries, are very expensive, and lack a
systematic mechanism to control the design complexity. Herein, we address these
limitations by proposing a mesh-free and simultaneous framework based on
physics-informed Gaussian processes (GPs). In our approach, we parameterize the
design and state variables with GP priors which have independent kernels but
share a multi-output neural network (NN) as their mean function. The
architecture of this NN is based on Parametric Grid Convolutional Attention
Networks (PGCANs) which not only mitigate spectral bias issues, but also
provide an interpretable mechanism to control design complexity. We estimate
all the parameters of our GP-based representations by simultaneously minimizing
the compliance, total potential energy, and residual of volume fraction
constraint. Importantly, our loss function exclude all data-based residuals as
GPs automatically satisfy them. We also develop computational schemes based on
curriculum training and numerical integration to increase the efficiency and
robustness of our approach which is shown to (1) produce super-resolution
topologies with fast convergence, (2) achieve smaller compliance and less gray
area fraction compared to traditional numerical methods, (3) provide control
over fine-scale features, and (4) outperform competing ML-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, graph-based machine learning techniques, such as
reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have garnered significant
attention. While some recent studies have started to explore the relationship
between the graph structure of neural networks and their predictive
performance, they often limit themselves to a narrow range of model networks,
particularly lacking mesoscale structures such as communities. Our work
advances this area by conducting a more comprehensive investigation,
incorporating realistic network structures characterized by heterogeneous
degree distributions and community structures, which are typical
characteristics of many real networks. These community structures offer a
nuanced perspective on network architecture. Our analysis employs model
networks such as random and scale-free networks, alongside a comparison with a
biological neural network and its subsets for more detailed analysis. We
examine the impact of these structural attributes on the performance of image
classification tasks. Our findings reveal that structural properties do affect
performance to some extent. Specifically, networks featuring coherent, densely
interconnected communities demonstrate enhanced learning capabilities. The
comparison with the biological neural network emphasizes the relevance of our
findings to real-world structures, suggesting an intriguing connection worth
further exploration. This study contributes meaningfully to network science and
machine learning, providing insights that could inspire the design of more
biologically informed neural networks.

Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT represent a significant
advancement in single-cell omics, with an ability to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream biological tasks. However, these models are
inherently limited in that a vast amount of information in biology exists as
text, which they are unable to leverage. There have therefore been several
recent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell
foundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little
understanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus
on using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to
single-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what
biological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to
single-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies
between scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these
insights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either
of its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between
each other across datasets. We also experiment with alternate fusion methods,
demonstrating the potential of combining specialized reasoning models with
scGPT to improve performance. This study ultimately showcases the potential for
LLMs to complement single-cell foundation models and drive improvements in
single-cell analysis.

Conclusion: 该流程显著提升了对抗性鲁棒决策树训练的效率和可持续性。

Abstract: As machine learning gets adopted into the industry quickly, trustworthiness
is increasingly in focus. Yet, efficiency and sustainability of robust training
pipelines still have to be established. In this work, we consider a simple
pipeline for training adversarially robust decision trees and investigate the
efficiency of each step. Our pipeline consists of three stages. Firstly, we
choose the perturbation size automatically for each dataset. For that, we
introduce a simple algorithm, instead of relying on intuition or prior work.
Moreover, we show that the perturbation size can be estimated from smaller
models than the one intended for full training, and thus significant gains in
efficiency can be achieved. Secondly, we train state-of-the-art adversarial
training methods and evaluate them regarding both their training time and
adversarial accuracy. Thirdly, we certify the robustness of each of the models
thus obtained and investigate the time required for this. We find that
verification time, which is critical to the efficiency of the full pipeline, is
not correlated with training time.

Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for

parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these
models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory
to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show
that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing
method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of
parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the
original models.

Result: 实验表明PRRO显著提升合成数据的预测性能，最高达871.46%，并改善类别分布相似性43%。

Conclusion: PRRO实现了合成数据与监督学习的无缝集成，提升数据分析的质量和可访问性。

Abstract: Tabular data synthesis for supervised learning ('SL') model training is
gaining popularity in industries such as healthcare, finance, and retail.
Despite the progress made in tabular data generators, models trained with
synthetic data often underperform compared to those trained with original data.
This low SL utility of synthetic data stems from class imbalance exaggeration
and SL data relationship overlooked by tabular generator. To address these
challenges, we draw inspirations from techniques in emerging data-centric
artificial intelligence and elucidate Pruning and ReOrdering ('PRRO'), a novel
pipeline that integrates data-centric techniques into tabular data synthesis.
PRRO incorporates data pruning to guide the table generator towards
observations with high signal-to-noise ratio, ensuring that the class
distribution of synthetic data closely matches that of the original data.
Besides, PRRO employs a column reordering algorithm to align the data modeling
structure of generators with that of SL models. These two modules enable PRRO
to optimize SL utility of synthetic data. Empirical experiments on 22 public
datasets show that synthetic data generated using PRRO enhances predictive
performance compared to data generated without PRRO. Specifically, synthetic
replacement of original data yields an average improvement of 26.74% and up to
871.46% improvement using PRRO, while synthetic appendant to original data
results with PRRO-generated data results in an average improvement of 6.13% and
up to 200.32%. Furthermore, experiments on six highly imbalanced datasets show
that PRRO enables the generator to produce synthetic data with a class
distribution that resembles the original data more closely, achieving a
similarity improvement of 43%. Through PRRO, we foster a seamless integration
of data synthesis to subsequent SL prediction, promoting quality and accessible
data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from
suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about
importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a
variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance
reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the
distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under
general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We
theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order
stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an
additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the
expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the
horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent
sample complexity.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing
sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of
renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a
neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet
transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of
time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the
Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections
to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through
wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly
captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated
across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity
transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this
architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various
forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal
dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP
analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

Motivation: 联邦学习在机器人抓取任务中面临非独立同分布数据和数据量不足的挑战，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出MTF-Grasp方法，选择数据质量高的机器人训练初始模型，再分发给其他机器人。

Result: 在Cornell和Jacquard数据集上，性能比传统联邦学习提升8%。

Conclusion: MTF-Grasp有效解决了非独立同分布数据问题，提升了机器人抓取任务的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that enables
participating devices to train privacy-preserved and collaborative models. FL
has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks
lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without
moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot
learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID)
and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in
robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL
approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the
non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness.
MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of
"top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It
then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them
to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance
degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL
setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping
datasets.

Conclusion: FedAcross+ 是一个实用且高效的解决方案，适用于非平稳环境和资源受限的工业场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized,
privacy-preserving learning, particularly relevant in the era of interconnected
edge devices equipped with sensors. However, the practical implementation of
Federated Learning faces three primary challenges: the need for human
involvement in costly data labelling processes for target adaptation, covariate
shift in client device data collection due to environmental factors affecting
sensors, leading to discrepancies between source and target samples, and the
impracticality of continuous or regular model updates in resource-constrained
environments due to limited data transmission capabilities and technical
constraints on channel availability and energy efficiency. To tackle these
issues, we expand upon an efficient and scalable Federated Learning framework
tailored for real-world client adaptation in industrial settings. This
framework leverages a pre-trained source model comprising a deep backbone, an
adaptation module, and a classifier running on a powerful server. By freezing
the backbone and classifier during client adaptation on resource-constrained
devices, we allow the domain adaptive linear layer to handle target domain
adaptation, thus minimizing overall computational overhead. Furthermore, this
setup, designated as FedAcross+, is extended to encompass the processing of
streaming data, thereby rendering the solution suitable for non-stationary
environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
FedAcross+ in achieving competitive adaptation on low-end client devices with
limited target samples, successfully addressing the challenge of domain shift.
Moreover, our framework accommodates sporadic model updates within
resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical and seamless deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TN秩在张量网络分解中至关重要，但其缺乏统一解释和直观理解，常被作为超参数调整而非设计参数。本文希望通过直观方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实际案例和图形化方法解释TN秩的选择，特别是在CP和Tucker分解中，并推广到任意阶张量。

Result: 揭示了TN秩与张量展开矩阵秩的关系，简化了复杂张量代数，为TN设计提供了领域知识的支持。

Conclusion: 本文为读者提供了对TN秩的清晰统一理解，支持在实际应用和教育中选择和解释张量方法。

Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in
Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank
representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in
handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of
TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions.
However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an
intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across
different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as
empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters
inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to
demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks
through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by
illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in
widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker
decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory
graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a
perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the
corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing
cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN
design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear
and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary
physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and
deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational
contexts.

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and

Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace

the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain
abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM
autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level
play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a
meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space,
reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent
space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within
studied AI players.

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning methods have recently emerged as powerful tools for
modelling relational data evolving through time. However, despite extensive
benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as
periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we
introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set
of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs
to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that
isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions,
inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over
both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning
methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to
generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the
limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional
real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with
stronger temporal reasoning abilities. The code for T-GRAB can be found at:

Abstract: This paper analyzes neural networks through graph variables and statistical
sufficiency. We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations,
where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor
points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer
outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the
conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. Under
dense anchor point assumptions, we prove that asymptotic sufficiency holds in
the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. To align more
closely with practical architectures, we further show that sufficiency can be
achieved with finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input
distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. Our framework covers
fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid
activations, and convolutional neural networks. This work bridges statistical
sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a
new statistical understanding of neural networks.

Conclusion: KAPI-ELM是一种高效、可扩展且通用的物理信息学习框架，适用于复杂PDE问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Kernel Adaptive Physics-Informed Extreme Learning
Machine (KAPI-ELM), an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF)-based extension of
PI-ELM designed to solve both forward and inverse Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) problems involving localized sharp gradients. While PI-ELMs outperform
the traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in speed due to their
single-shot, least square optimization, this advantage comes at a cost: their
fixed, randomly initialized input layer limits their ability to capture sharp
gradients. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a lightweight Bayesian
Optimization (BO) framework that, instead of adjusting each input layer
parameter individually as in traditional backpropagation, learns a small set of
hyperparameters defining the statistical distribution from which the input
weights are drawn. This novel distributional optimization strategy -- combining
BO for input layer distributional parameters with least-squares optimization
for output layer network parameters -- enables KAPI-ELM to preserve PI-ELM's
speed while matching or exceeding the expressiveness of PINNs. We validate the
proposed methodology on several challenging forward and inverse PDE benchmarks,
including a 1D singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equation, a 2D Poisson
equation with sharp localized sources, and a time-dependent advection equation.
Notably, KAPI-ELM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both forward and
inverse settings. In stiff PDE regimes, it matches or even outperforms advanced
methods such as the Extended Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC), while
requiring nearly an order of magnitude fewer tunable parameters. These results
establish the potential of KAPI-ELM as a scalable, interpretable, and
generalizable physics-informed learning framework, especially in stiff PDE
regimes.

Conclusion: SAFE-T展示了条件生成化学语言模型在统一评分与生成任务中的潜力，可加速早期药物发现。

Abstract: Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains
limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of
interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical
modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein
targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without
relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T
models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a
biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such
as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff
detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this
learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In
comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,
ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being
significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T
captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and
biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these
results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and
generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for unsupervised learning
with numerous applications. However, in the application of modern algorithms,
the datasets studied are usually large and dynamic. If the hierarchical
clustering is sensitive to small perturbations of the dataset, the usability of
the algorithm will be greatly reduced. In this paper, we focus on the
hierarchical $k$ -median clustering problem, which bridges hierarchical and
centroid-based clustering while offering theoretical appeal, practical utility,
and improved interpretability. We analyze the average sensitivity of algorithms
for this problem by measuring the expected change in the output when a random
data point is deleted. We propose an efficient algorithm for hierarchical
$k$-median clustering and theoretically prove its low average sensitivity and
high clustering quality. Additionally, we show that single linkage clustering
and a deterministic variant of the CLNSS algorithm exhibit high average
sensitivity, making them less stable. Finally, we validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments.

Conclusion: Demenba为痴呆评估提供了更透明、可扩展的工具，未来可结合大语言模型优化性能。

Abstract: Early detection of dementia is critical for timely medical intervention and
improved patient outcomes. Neuropsychological tests are widely used for
cognitive assessment but have traditionally relied on manual scoring. Automatic
dementia classification (ADC) systems aim to infer cognitive decline directly
from speech recordings of such tests. We propose Demenba, a novel ADC framework
based on state space models, which scale linearly in memory and computation
with sequence length. Trained on over 1,000 hours of cognitive assessments
administered to Framingham Heart Study participants, some of whom were
diagnosed with dementia through adjudicated review, our method outperforms
prior approaches in fine-grained dementia classification by 21\%, while using
fewer parameters. We further analyze its scaling behavior and demonstrate that
our model gains additional improvement when fused with large language models,
paving the way for more transparent and scalable dementia assessment tools.

### [183] [Convergence of Agnostic Federated Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10325)
*Herlock,Rahimi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦学习（FL）中客户端随机参与的问题，提出了在非均匀参与分布下无需先验知识的收敛性分析，并证明其优于加权聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际FL部署中客户端间歇性参与和未知参与概率的问题，现有方法假设过于理想化，难以适用于现实场景。

Method: 通过随机动态建模分析联邦平均算法（FedAvg）在非均匀客户端参与下的优化问题，并证明其收敛性。

Result: 在凸且可能非光滑损失函数下，实现了标准收敛速率$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$，且无需参与分布的先验知识。

Conclusion: 该研究首次为非均匀随机参与的FedAvg提供了收敛保证，并通过实验验证其优于加权聚合方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without
centralizing raw data. However, practical FL deployments often face a key
realistic challenge: Clients participate intermittently in server aggregation
and with unknown, possibly biased participation probabilities. Most existing
convergence results either assume full-device participation, or rely on
knowledge of (in fact uniform) client availability distributions -- assumptions
that rarely hold in practice. In this work, we characterize the optimization
problem that consistently adheres to the stochastic dynamics of the well-known
\emph{agnostic Federated Averaging (FedAvg)} algorithm under random (and
variably-sized) client availability, and rigorously establish its convergence
for convex, possibly nonsmooth losses, achieving a standard rate of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ denotes the aggregation horizon. Our
analysis provides the first convergence guarantees for agnostic FedAvg under
general, non-uniform, stochastic client participation, without knowledge of the
participation distribution. We also empirically demonstrate that agnostic
FedAvg in fact outperforms common (and suboptimal) weighted aggregation FedAvg
variants, even with server-side knowledge of participation weights.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统比较统计、机器学习和深度学习的插补方法，填补了IMU运动捕捉数据缺失值处理的性能评估空白，并提出首个公开数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动捕捉数据在体育科学中应用广泛，但数据缺失问题影响其效用，现有研究缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 采用统计、机器学习和深度学习方法，在三种缺失机制下（MCAR、块缺失和信号转换点依赖缺失）进行多变量和单变量插补比较。

Result: 多变量插补方法显著优于单变量方法，尤其在复杂缺失模式下，如转换点缺失时MAE降低50%。GAIN和迭代插补器表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来运动捕捉数据插补提供了基准，并提出了提升数据完整性和鲁棒性的实用建议。

Abstract: Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often
compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a
systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is
lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis
of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our
evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,
multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To
facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap
dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate
practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing
completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent
pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic
variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks
consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex
missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean
absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate
techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative
Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the
highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical
baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving
the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.

Motivation: 研究ReLU神经网络在高维空间中逼近Korobov函数的能力，以验证其表达能力是否受维度诅咒的限制。

Method: 利用稀疏网格有限元和比特提取技术，分析网络宽度和深度对逼近误差的影响。

Result: 在$L_p$范数下得到$2m$阶的超逼近误差界限，在$W^1_p$范数下得到$2m-2$阶的误差界限。

Conclusion: 结果表明，ReLU神经网络在高维空间中具有强大的表达能力，且不受维度诅咒的显著影响。

Abstract: This paper examines the $L_p$ and $W^1_p$ norm approximation errors of ReLU
neural networks for Korobov functions. In terms of network width and depth, we
derive nearly optimal super-approximation error bounds of order $2m$ in the
$L_p$ norm and order $2m-2$ in the $W^1_p$ norm, for target functions with
$L_p$ mixed derivative of order $m$ in each direction. The analysis leverages
sparse grid finite elements and the bit extraction technique. Our results
improve upon classical lowest order $L_\infty$ and $H^1$ norm error bounds and
demonstrate that the expressivity of neural networks is largely unaffected by
the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: In this paper, we design an algorithm to accelerate the diffusion process on
the $SO(3)$ manifold. The inherently sequential nature of diffusion models
necessitates substantial time for denoising perturbed data. To overcome this
limitation, we proposed to adapt the numerical Picard iteration for the $SO(3)$
space. We demonstrate our algorithm on an existing method that employs
diffusion models to address the pose ambiguity problem. Moreover, we show that
this acceleration advantage occurs without any measurable degradation in task
reward. The experiments reveal that our algorithm achieves a speed-up of up to
4.9$\times$, significantly reducing the latency for generating a single sample.

Conclusion: FedFD通过特征蒸馏和正交投影技术，有效解决了模型异构联邦学习中的知识偏差问题，提升了全局模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing
attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models
while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,
ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often
employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global
model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not
always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The
reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,
while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for
the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous
Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature
information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous
models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge
distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to
maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align
the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize
the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and
thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的峰值需求预测对供应链管理和客户购物体验至关重要，尤其是在高销量事件期间，传统方法难以应对。

Method: TAT模型包含编码器和解码器，均嵌入了新颖的Temporal Alignment Attention（TAA）机制，利用已知的上下文变量（如节假日和促销信息）提升预测性能。

Result: 在两个大型电商数据集上的实验表明，TAT在峰值需求预测上实现了高达30%的准确率提升，同时整体性能优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: TAT通过上下文依赖的对齐机制显著提升了峰值需求预测的准确性，为供应链管理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Multi-horizon time series forecasting has many practical applications such as
demand forecasting. Accurate demand prediction is critical to help make buying
and inventory decisions for supply chain management of e-commerce and physical
retailers, and such predictions are typically required for future horizons
extending tens of weeks. This is especially challenging during high-stake sales
events when demand peaks are particularly difficult to predict accurately.
However, these events are important not only for managing supply chain
operations but also for ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
To address this challenge, we propose Temporal-Aligned Transformer (TAT), a
multi-horizon forecaster leveraging apriori-known context variables such as
holiday and promotion events information for improving predictive performance.
Our model consists of an encoder and decoder, both embedded with a novel
Temporal Alignment Attention (TAA), designed to learn context-dependent
alignment for peak demand forecasting. We conduct extensive empirical analysis
on two large-scale proprietary datasets from a large e-commerce retailer. We
demonstrate that TAT brings up to 30% accuracy improvement on peak demand
forecasting while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DeepONet在岩土工程中的应用潜力，解决传统方法计算效率低的问题。

Method: 评估了四种DeepONet架构，包括标准架构和改进的物理启发架构（Model 3和Model 4）。

Result: Model 4表现最佳，计算速度提升1.5至100倍，适用于快速变化的函数。

Conclusion: DeepONet在岩土工程中具有高效、通用的潜力，推动了科学机器学习在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a powerful surrogate
modeling framework for learning solution operators in PDE-governed systems.
While their use is expanding across engineering disciplines, applications in
geotechnical engineering remain limited. This study systematically evaluates
several DeepONet architectures for the one-dimensional consolidation problem.
We initially consider three architectures: a standard DeepONet with the
coefficient of consolidation embedded in the branch net (Models 1 and 2), and a
physics-inspired architecture with the coefficient embedded in the trunk net
(Model 3). Results show that Model 3 outperforms the standard configurations
(Models 1 and 2) but still has limitations when the target solution (excess
pore pressures) exhibits significant variation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Trunknet Fourier feature-enhanced DeepONet (Model 4) that addresses
the identified limitations by capturing rapidly varying functions. All proposed
architectures achieve speedups ranging from 1.5 to 100 times over traditional
explicit and implicit solvers, with Model 4 being the most efficient. Larger
computational savings are expected for more complex systems than the explored
1D case, which is promising. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
DeepONets to enable efficient, generalizable surrogate modeling in geotechnical
applications, advancing the integration of scientific machine learning in
geotechnics, which is at an early stage.

Abstract: With the rise of smart mobility and shared e-mobility services, numerous
advanced technologies have been applied to this field. Cloud-based traffic
simulation solutions have flourished, offering increasingly realistic
representations of the evolving mobility landscape. LLMs have emerged as
pioneering tools, providing robust support for various applications, including

application for personalized route recommendations. The optimization module is
evaluated based on travel time and cost across different traffic scenarios.
Additionally, the LLM-powered RAG framework is evaluated at the schema level
for different users, using various evaluation methods. Schema-level RAG with
XiYanSQL achieves an average execution accuracy of 0.81 on system operator
queries and 0.98 on user queries.

Motivation: 电子商务搜索引擎面临查询模糊、词汇不对齐等问题，传统方法未能充分利用语义标签信息。

Method: 将查询重构任务建模为令牌分类问题，设计依赖感知Transformer模型TagBERT，利用令牌的语义标签学习更优查询短语嵌入。

Result: 在大型电子商务数据集上，TagBERT性能优于BERT、eBERT和序列到序列Transformer模型。

Conclusion: TagBERT通过利用语义标签信息，显著提升了查询重构任务的性能。

Abstract: The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most
relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a
query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous
queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or
under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To
address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user
query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to
bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early
methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from
token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or
purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically
transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are
being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize
the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user
intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a
token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware
transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of
a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,
real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance
than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and
Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂反应机制搜索提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reaction mechanism search tools have demonstrated the ability to provide
insights into likely products and rate-limiting steps of reacting systems.
However, reactions involving several concerted bond changes - as can be found
in many key steps of natural product synthesis - can complicate the search
process. To mitigate these complications, we present a mechanism search
strategy particularly suited to help expedite exploration of an exemplary
family of such complex reactions, cyclizations. We provide a cost-effective
strategy for identifying relevant elementary reaction steps by combining
graph-based enumeration schemes and machine learning techniques for
intermediate filtering. Key to this approach is our use of a neural network
potential (NNP), AIMNet2-rxn, for computational evaluation of each candidate
reaction pathway. In this article, we evaluate the NNP's ability to estimate
activation energies, demonstrate the correct anticipation of stereoselectivity,
and recapitulate complex enabling steps in natural product synthesis.

Conclusion: SON成功实现了算子学习中的不确定性量化，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: We develop a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in operator
learning, the Stochastic Operator Network (SON). SON combines the stochastic
optimal control concepts of the Stochastic Neural Network (SNN) with the
DeepONet. By formulating the branch net as an SDE and backpropagating through
the adjoint BSDE, we replace the gradient of the loss function with the
gradient of the Hamiltonian from Stohastic Maximum Principle in the SGD update.
This allows SON to learn the uncertainty present in operators through its
diffusion parameters. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of SON when
replicating several noisy operators in 2D and 3D.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是实现高效能AI解决方案的有效方法。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of balancing energy efficiency with
performance in AI/ML models, focusing on DeepRX, a deep learning receiver based
on a fully convolutional ResNet architecture. We evaluate the energy
consumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and
FLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,
influenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy
dynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the
application of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX
\textit{student} model that emulates the performance of the \textit{teacher}
model but with reduced energy consumption. We experiment with different student
model sizes, optimal teacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is
measured by comparing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance versus
Signal-to-Interference \& Noise Ratio (SINR) values of the distilled model and
a model trained from scratch. The distilled models demonstrate a lower error
floor across SINR levels, highlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving
energy-efficient AI solutions.

Motivation: 传统的共形预测方法在数据分布偏移时覆盖率保证失效，现有方法需要预先知道偏移类型，限制了实用性。

Result: 研究表明，可以在分布偏移情况下有效估计并缓解覆盖率损失。

Conclusion: 最优传输理论为共形预测在非交换性数据下的应用提供了新思路和解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method
that has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its
finite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split
conformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to
collecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet
seen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration
and test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and
often violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature
is rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable
setting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of
distribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this
problem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show
that it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of
distribution shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线持续学习中数据以小批量到达、计算预算固定且无任务边界时，自监督学习技术不足的问题。

Method: 提出Continual Latent Alignment (CLA)，通过对齐当前模型学习到的表征与过去的表征来减少遗忘。

Result: CLA加速了在线场景下的训练收敛，并在相同计算预算下优于现有方法；作为预训练协议时，其早期表现优于全独立同分布预训练。

Conclusion: CLA是一种有效的在线持续学习自监督策略，既能减少遗忘，又能提升性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is able to build latent representations that
generalize well to unseen data. However, only a few SSL techniques exist for
the online CL setting, where data arrives in small minibatches, the model must
comply with a fixed computational budget, and task boundaries are absent. We
introduce Continual Latent Alignment (CLA), a novel SSL strategy for Online CL
that aligns the representations learned by the current model with past
representations to mitigate forgetting. We found that our CLA is able to speed
up the convergence of the training process in the online scenario,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under the same computational budget.
Surprisingly, we also discovered that using CLA as a pretraining protocol in
the early stages of pretraining leads to a better final performance when
compared to a full i.i.d. pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for
addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been
shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual
understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations
of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that
probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we
go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final
performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the
performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual
encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In
doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important
observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual
information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving
VLMs.

such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a.
``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis)
of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the
case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate
vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /
locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time
LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT
and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like
conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these
generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects
of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from
adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a
simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic
computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from
limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of
this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of
``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv
skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in
collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping
Jiang, and Milad Siami.

### [199] [The Target Polish: A New Approach to Outlier-Resistant Non-Negative Matrix and Tensor Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10484)
*Paul Fogel,Christophe Geissler,George Luta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Target Polish是一种高效的非负矩阵和张量分解框架，结合加权中位数变换和Fast-HALS算法，在保持快速收敛的同时抵抗异常值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统加权NMF方法对异常值鲁棒但收敛慢，需改进以兼顾效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过加权中位数变换自适应平滑数据，结合Fast-HALS算法实现快速更新。

Result: 在图像数据集上，Target Polish的准确性与现有方法相当或更好，计算时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: Target Polish在鲁棒性和计算效率上取得平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces the "Target Polish," a robust and computationally
efficient framework for nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization. Although
conventional weighted NMF approaches are resistant to outliers, they converge
slowly due to the use of multiplicative updates to minimize the objective
criterion. In contrast, the Target Polish approach remains compatible with the
Fast-HALS algorithm, which is renowned for its speed, by adaptively smoothing
the data with a weighted median-based transformation. This innovation provides
outlier resistance while maintaining the highly efficient additive update
structure of Fast-HALS. Empirical evaluations using image datasets corrupted
with structured (block) and unstructured (salt) noise demonstrate that the
Target Polish approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art
robust NMF methods and reduces computational time by an order of magnitude in
the studied scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了弹性权重巩固（EWC）在持续学习中的作用，通过实验验证其在减少遗忘方面的有效性，同时探讨了其在新任务学习效率上的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，验证EWC方法的有效性。

Method: 使用PermutedMNIST和RotatedMNIST基准测试，比较EWC与L2正则化和SGD的效果，并分析超参数和dropout的影响。

Result: EWC显著减少遗忘，但略微降低新任务学习效率；超参数和dropout对结果有影响。

Conclusion: EWC是神经网络终身学习的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is the primary challenge that hinders continual
learning, which refers to a neural network ability to sequentially learn
multiple tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. Elastic Weight
Consolidation, a regularization-based approach inspired by synaptic
consolidation in biological neural systems, has been used to overcome this
problem. In this study prior research is replicated and extended by evaluating
EWC in supervised learning settings using the PermutedMNIST and RotatedMNIST
benchmarks. Through systematic comparisons with L2 regularization and
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without regularization, we analyze how
different approaches balance knowledge retention and adaptability. Our results
confirm what was shown in previous research, showing that EWC significantly
reduces forgetting compared to naive training while slightly compromising
learning efficiency on new tasks. Moreover, we investigate the impact of
dropout regularization and varying hyperparameters, offering insights into the
generalization of EWC across diverse learning scenarios. These results
underscore EWC's potential as a viable solution for lifelong learning in neural
networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SplitHappens结合函数秘密共享（FSS）和U形分割学习（SL），提升数据隐私保护，同时降低通信和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管分割学习（SL）在保护客户端数据方面有潜力，但其易受攻击，现有方法未能全面解决隐私问题。

Method: 采用FSS和U形SL结合的方法，隐藏公共输入并随机掩码，保护训练数据标签。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少训练时间和通信成本的同时，保持了准确性，并抵御了模型反转和标签推断攻击。

Conclusion: SplitHappens在提升SL安全性的同时，优化了性能，适用于多种攻击场景。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) -- splits a model into two distinct parts to help protect
client data while enhancing Machine Learning (ML) processes. Though promising,
SL has proven vulnerable to different attacks, thus raising concerns about how
effective it may be in terms of data privacy. Recent works have shown promising
results for securing SL through the use of a novel paradigm, named Function
Secret Sharing (FSS), in which servers obtain shares of a function they compute
and operate on a public input hidden with a random mask. However, these works
fall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In
SplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL. Similarly
to other works, we are able to make use of the benefits of SL by reducing the
communication and computational costs of FSS. However, a U-shaped SL provides a
higher security guarantee than previous works, allowing a client to keep the
labels of the training data secret, without having to share them with the
server. Through this, we are able to generalize the security analysis of
previous works and expand it to different attack vectors, such as modern model
inversion attacks as well as label inference attacks. We tested our approach
for two different convolutional neural networks on different datasets. These
experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the training
time as well as the communication costs when compared to simply using FSS while
matching prior accuracy.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a
lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build
robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop
that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across
imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We
identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity
and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of
publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building
benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological
systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data
curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open,
collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust
benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for
ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately
advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries,
therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

TL;DR: 论文分析了在重尾类别不平衡分布下，常见的隐私学习优化算法的行为，发现DP-GD在低频类别学习中表现不佳，而基于二阶信息的算法（如DP-AdamBC）能有效避免这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究隐私学习优化算法在重尾类别不平衡分布下的表现差异，特别是针对低频类别的学习效果。

Method: 通过理论模型和实验（包括控制实验和真实数据）比较DP-GD和DP-AdamBC的性能。

Result: DP-AdamBC在低频类别学习中表现更优，训练准确率分别提高了约8%和5%。

Conclusion: DP-AdamBC通过消除DP偏差，能更好地适应重尾类别不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the optimization behaviour of common private
learning optimization algorithms under heavy-tail class imbalanced
distribution. We show that, in a stylized model, optimizing with Gradient
Descent with differential privacy (DP-GD) suffers when learning low-frequency
classes, whereas optimization algorithms that estimate second-order information
do not. In particular, DP-AdamBC that removes the DP bias from estimating loss
curvature is a crucial component to avoid the ill-condition caused by
heavy-tail class imbalance, and empirically fits the data better with
$\approx8\%$ and $\approx5\%$ increase in training accuracy when learning the
least frequent classes on both controlled experiments and real data
respectively.

TL;DR: Graph World Model (GWM) 是一个支持多模态和图结构数据的通用世界模型，通过消息传递算法和动作节点实现跨领域任务的高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型主要关注非结构化数据，无法利用普遍存在的图结构数据；而现有的图基础模型又局限于图学习任务，无法扩展到多模态数据和跨学科任务。

Method: GWM 通过消息传递算法聚合结构化信息，支持多模态数据（文本或嵌入空间），并引入动作节点以链接不同任务。

Result: 在六个跨领域任务中，GWM 表现优于或与领域专用基线相当，并展示了强大的零样本/少样本能力。

Conclusion: GWM 是一个通用的世界模型，能够高效处理多模态和图结构数据，并在跨领域任务中表现出色。

Abstract: World models (WMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in prediction, generation,
and planning tasks. Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and
cannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in
the digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,
they focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal
data and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the
Graph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and
graph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse
tasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to
aggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space
by converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal
embedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E). Notably, GWM introduces
action nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other
nodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on
six tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,
recommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,
and planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches
domain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and
demonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks. Our
code for GWM is released at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GWM.

TL;DR: 论文提出FusionBench和FusionFactory，通过多级融合框架（查询级、思维级、模型级）优化LLM路由，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前应用多依赖单一后端模型，无法充分利用不同LLM的互补优势，导致性能和成本效率低下。

Method: 提出FusionBench基准和FusionFactory框架，包括查询级、思维级和模型级融合，利用路由数据和思维模板优化模型选择。

Result: FusionFactory在所有14个基准测试中均优于单一LLM，验证了系统融合的价值。

Conclusion: 系统化融合LLM能有效利用互补优势，提升整体性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant
ecosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to
differences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most
applications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of
capabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when
tackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing
data, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different
models, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,
we propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks
across five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing
103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.
Building on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework
with three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query
using both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level
fusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers
to similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities
between models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as
training data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best
individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations
varying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in
harnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解缠方法，通过拆分嵌套规则节点来提升神经DNF模型的性能，使其在符号翻译后更接近翻译前的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经DNF模型在符号翻译过程中因阈值处理导致性能下降，部分原因是未能解缠网络权重中学习到的知识。

Method: 提出解缠方法，将编码嵌套规则的节点拆分为更小的独立节点，以更好地保留模型性能。

Result: 在二元、多类和多标签分类任务中，该方法提供了紧凑且可解释的逻辑表示，性能更接近翻译前的模型。

Conclusion: 解缠方法有效提升了神经DNF模型的性能，同时保持了其可解释性。

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and
interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising
results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior
knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the
thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here
that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its
failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the
networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement
method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent
nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through
experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks
(including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our
disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical
representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to
that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at
https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型Spatial ModernBERT，用于从复杂财务文档中提取表格和键值对，通过空间嵌入和多任务分类头实现高精度提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从财务文档中提取表格和键值对对于审计、数据分析和自动化发票处理等业务流程至关重要。

Method: 模型采用多任务分类头（标签、列、行）进行标记分类，结合空间嵌入和B-I-IB标记后处理，预训练于PubTables-1M数据集并微调于财务文档数据集。

Result: 实验表明，模型能有效利用文本和空间线索，在真实财务文档中实现高精度的表格和键值对提取。

Conclusion: Spatial ModernBERT通过结合空间嵌入和多任务分类，显著提升了财务文档中表格和键值对的提取效果。

Abstract: Extracting tables and key-value pairs from financial documents is essential
for business workflows such as auditing, data analytics, and automated invoice
processing. In this work, we introduce Spatial ModernBERT-a transformer-based
model augmented with spatial embeddings-to accurately detect and extract
tabular data and key-value fields from complex financial documents. We cast the
extraction task as token classification across three heads: (1) Label Head,
classifying each token as a label (e.g., PO Number, PO Date, Item Description,
Quantity, Base Cost, MRP, etc.); (2) Column Head, predicting column indices;
(3) Row Head, distinguishing the start of item rows and header rows. The model
is pretrained on the PubTables-1M dataset, then fine-tuned on a financial
document dataset, achieving robust performance through cross-entropy loss on
each classification head. We propose a post-processing method to merge tokens
using B-I-IB tagging, reconstruct the tabular layout, and extract key-value
pairs. Empirical evaluation shows that Spatial ModernBERT effectively leverages
both textual and spatial cues, facilitating highly accurate table and key-value
extraction in real-world financial documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEALGuard是一种多语言护栏，旨在提升LLM系统在多语言环境下的安全对齐能力，显著优于现有方法如LlamaGuard。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有护栏（如LlamaGuard）在多语言不安全输入（尤其是低资源语言）中表现不佳，导致LLM系统易受攻击。

Method: 通过低秩适应（LoRA）将通用多语言模型转化为多语言护栏，并构建SEALSBench数据集（含26万条多语言提示）。

Result: SEALGuard在多语言不安全提示检测中表现优异，DSR提升48%，优于LlamaGuard。

Conclusion: SEALGuard通过有效的多语言护栏设计，显著提升了LLM系统的安全对齐能力。

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent
LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection
accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),
they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM
systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource
languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a
multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse
languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing
guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in
LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model
into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct
SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over
260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.
We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on
this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak
prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art
LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and
18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In
contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual
unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and
achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further
reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the
overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of
LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

Result: 现有数据集缺乏临床真实性、透明性和验证过程；挑战问题虽有益但规模小、范围窄且可能被LLM训练数据覆盖。

Conclusion: 需建立标准化框架和合作机制，以确保数据集和方法严谨、无偏且能反映临床复杂性。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the current limitations of large language models
(LLMs) in medical question answering, focusing on the quality of datasets used
for their evaluation. Materials and Methods: Widely-used benchmark datasets,
including MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU, were reviewed for their rigor,
transparency, and relevance to clinical scenarios. Alternatives, such as
challenge questions in medical journals, were also analyzed to identify their
potential as unbiased evaluation tools. Results: Most existing datasets lack
clinical realism, transparency, and robust validation processes. Publicly
available challenge questions offer some benefits but are limited by their
small size, narrow scope, and exposure to LLM training. These gaps highlight
the need for secure, comprehensive, and representative datasets. Conclusion: A
standardized framework is critical for evaluating LLMs in medicine.
Collaborative efforts among institutions and policymakers are needed to ensure
datasets and methodologies are rigorous, unbiased, and reflective of clinical
complexities.

Result: SIMS在多样化的LLM和基准测试中表现优于现有方法，展示了更高的引导效果和适应性。

Conclusion: 自改进模型引导是未来LLM推理时对齐研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: Model steering represents a powerful technique that dynamically aligns large
language models (LLMs) with human preferences during inference. However,
conventional model-steering methods rely heavily on externally annotated data,
not only limiting their adaptability to varying contexts but also tethering
their effectiveness to annotation quality. In this paper, we present SIMS, the
first self-improving model-steering framework that operates without relying on
external supervision. At its core, SIMS autonomously generates and refines
contrastive samples through iterative self-improvement cycles, enabling
adaptive, context-specific steering. Additionally, SIMS employs novel
strategies, including prompt ranking and contrast sampling, to further enhance
steering efficacy. Extensive evaluation across diverse LLMs and benchmarks
demonstrates that SIMS substantially outperforms existing methods in steering
effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting self-improving model steering as a
promising direction for future research on inference-time LLM alignment.

Abstract: Introduction: Electronic health records (EHR) are a critical medium through
which patient stigmatization is perpetuated among healthcare teams. Methods: We
identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in
MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning
classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using
Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing
labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16),
patients with Medicare/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46),
self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and
mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though
male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased
stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),
with similar patterns of doubt markers. Discussion: Stigmatizing language
occurred at higher rates among historically stigmatized patients, perpetuated

Result: 强想象者描述复杂自然内容，弱想象者报告简单几何模式；视觉语言模型更能捕捉这些差异。

Abstract: A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces
visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual
system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences
in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and
vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other
internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural
language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from
over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery
phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced
hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while
weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision
language models better captured these differences than text-only language
models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer
sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in
coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for
the imagery spectrum.

TL;DR: Lizard是一种线性化框架，将预训练的Transformer大模型转化为支持无限上下文生成的次二次复杂度架构，解决了内存和计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在上下文长度增加时面临内存和计算瓶颈，Lizard旨在通过次二次复杂度注意力机制解决这一问题。

Method: Lizard结合了门控线性注意力和滑动窗口注意力，引入硬件感知算法加速训练，并支持自适应内存控制。

Result: 实验表明，Lizard在标准语言建模任务中几乎无损恢复教师模型性能，并在MMLU基准测试中优于先前方法18分。

Conclusion: Lizard通过混合机制和硬件优化，显著提升了长上下文生成能力，为模型设计提供了更大灵活性。

Abstract: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic
architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face
significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,
due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value
(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic
attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while
preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are
often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating
mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent
state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports
constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more
flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global
context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,
forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and
fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware
algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive
experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher
model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while
significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU
benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant
improvements on associative recall tasks.

TL;DR: ALIGN系统通过动态个性化方法，利用提示对齐细粒度属性，优化基于LLM的决策辅助工具，支持模块化算法和定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM比较工具主要关注基准测试任务，而用户多样化的价值观和偏好需要更个性化的LLM对齐方法。

Method: 提出ALIGN系统，通过提示对齐细粒度属性，实现动态个性化，支持配置管理、结构化输出生成及可替换LLM核心算法。

Result: 系统支持定量分析，应用于公共意见调查和医疗分诊决策两个领域，展示了不同对齐方法的比较结果。

Conclusion: ALIGN框架开源，为可靠、负责任且个性化的LLM决策辅助工具研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids.
However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their
decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and
personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking
tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed
ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers
through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key
features of our system include robust configuration management, structured
output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with
swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user
interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their
alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm
integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing
alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public
opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The
entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable,
responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于推理的大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成和评论方面潜力巨大，但进展依赖于大规模高质量数据集。

Method: 采用两阶段监督微调策略：第一阶段专注于代码生成微调，第二阶段联合训练代码生成和评论模型。

Result: 微调后的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型在代码生成性能上优于或等于现有最佳开源模型，且代码生成与评论模型的结合显著提升了竞争性编程表现。

Conclusion: OpenCodeReasoning-II数据集和两阶段微调策略为代码推理任务提供了有效支持，同时扩展的LiveCodeBench基准进一步促进了LLM评估。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly their potential through test-time scaling, have created
significant opportunities for distillation in code generation and critique.
However, progress in both areas fundamentally depends on large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In this work, we introduce OpenCodeReasoning-II, a
dataset consists of 2.5M question-solution-critique triples (approx. 35K unique
programming questions), making it nearly twice the size of the previous largest
publicly available code reasoning dataset. In this work, we employ a two-stage
supervised fine-tuning strategy. The first stage focuses on fine-tuning for
code generation, while the second stage involves the joint training of models
for both code generation and critique. Our resulting finetuned Qwen2.5-Instruct
models achieve performance in code generation that either exceeds or equals the
best prior open-weight distilled models. Notably, the integration of our code
generation and critique models leads to significant improvements in competitive
coding performance. Furthermore, we present an extension of the LiveCodeBench
benchmark to specifically support the C++ programming language, thereby
facilitating more comprehensive LLM evaluation using this benchmark.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态参数记忆（DPM）机制，用于解决语音大语言模型（SLLM）在处理长音频序列时因高帧率导致的上下文窗口限制问题，显著提升了情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音模态的高帧率限制了SLLM的信号处理和理解能力，现有输入标记压缩方法忽视了情感在多轮对话中的连续性和惯性。

Method: 提出DPM机制，结合上下文语义和句子级情感编码，通过临时LoRA模块逐步编码句子级信息，实现有限上下文窗口下无限长度音频的处理。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，DPM显著提升了SLLM处理长音频序列时的情感识别能力，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DPM机制有效解决了SLLM在高帧率语音模态中的局限性，为情感识别任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to
improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame
rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding
capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only
process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its
capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the
continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This
paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual
semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of
unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM
progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary
LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual
information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM
into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental
results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion
recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences,
achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CompassJudger-2提升了评判模型的鲁棒性和可扩展性，并提出了新的评判标准JudgerBenchV2。

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has
gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow
specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for
comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel
generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven,
multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising
judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning
through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment
capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy
gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves
superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model
demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models
like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank
consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance
robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation
standards.

Motivation: 解决传统使用扫描教材可能带来的版权问题，同时帮助小模型理解XRD关键概念。

Method: 通过GPT-4.5生成紧凑的领域特定参考内容，并在217个专家级XRD问题上评估不同视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 使用GPT-4.5生成摘要的模型在准确性上有显著提升，特别是在晶体学知识有限的模型中。

Conclusion: OPENXRD展示了专业开放书籍系统在材料科学中的实用性，并为科学领域的自然语言处理工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for
crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with
concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned
textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact,
domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in
X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217
expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models,
including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN,
under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with
supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant
accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries,
particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses
knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and
shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively
in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based
inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams
or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials
science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can
be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural
language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 战略对话中欺骗检测的复杂性及类别不平衡问题（欺骗信息占比不足5%），需要一种高效且针对性的方法。

Method: 结合冻结BERT嵌入、可解释的语言和游戏特定特征，采用PU学习目标（Positive-Unlabeled）训练模型，专注于少数标注的欺骗信息。

Result: 模型在Diplomacy数据集上达到0.60的宏观F1值，同时减少了650倍以上的可训练参数。

Conclusion: PU学习、语言可解释性和说话者感知表示在欺骗检测中具有重要价值，且准确检测欺骗比识别真实信息更为关键。

Abstract: Detecting deception in strategic dialogues is a complex and high-stakes task
due to the subtlety of language and extreme class imbalance between deceptive
and truthful communications. In this work, we revisit deception detection in
the Diplomacy dataset, where less than 5% of messages are labeled deceptive. We
introduce a lightweight yet effective model combining frozen BERT embeddings,
interpretable linguistic and game-specific features, and a Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) learning objective. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, PU-Lie is
tailored for situations where only a small portion of deceptive messages are
labeled, and the majority are unlabeled. Our model achieves a new best macro F1
of 0.60 while reducing trainable parameters by over 650x. Through comprehensive
evaluations and ablation studies across seven models, we demonstrate the value
of PU learning, linguistic interpretability, and speaker-aware representations.
Notably, we emphasize that in this problem setting, accurately detecting
deception is more critical than identifying truthful messages. This priority
guides our choice of PU learning, which explicitly models the rare but vital
deceptive class.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of multimodal misinformation presents significant
challenges for automated fact-checking systems, especially when claims are
ambiguous or lack sufficient context. We introduce RAMA, a novel
retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed for verifying multimedia
misinformation. RAMA incorporates three core innovations: (1) strategic query
formulation that transforms multimodal claims into precise web search queries;
(2) cross-verification evidence aggregation from diverse, authoritative
sources; and (3) a multi-agent ensemble architecture that leverages the
complementary strengths of multiple multimodal large language models and prompt
variants. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAMA achieves superior
performance on benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in resolving
ambiguous or improbable claims by grounding verification in retrieved factual
evidence. Our findings underscore the necessity of integrating web-based
evidence and multi-agent reasoning for trustworthy multimedia verification,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable fact-checking solutions. RAMA
will be publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RAMA.git.

Result: 在多选题基准测试中，该方法显著提升性能，优于非剪枝的适应方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝微调方法有效增强模型的泛化能力，减少对数据集特定机制的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often develop learned mechanisms specialized to
specific datasets, such as reliance on domain-specific correlations, which
yield high-confidence predictions without generalizable reasoning. While
beneficial in one setting, these dataset-specific mechanisms typically degrade
performance when models encounter novel tasks or distributions. In this work,
we introduce a fine-tuning approach designed to enhance generalization by
identifying and pruning neurons associated with dataset-specific mechanisms in
transformer-based LLMs. Our method employs Integrated Gradients to quantify
each neuron's influence on high-confidence predictions, pinpointing those that
disproportionately contribute to dataset-specific performance without
supporting robust, transferable reasoning. Selectively pruning these neurons
compels the model to depend on generalizable representations. Evaluated across
multiple-choice benchmarks, our pruning-based fine-tuning significantly
enhances performance, surpassing prior (non-pruning) adaptation methods.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable progress across many
languages. However, Tibetan, as a representative low-resource language, is
particularly underrepresented in existing models due to the scarcity of
high-quality training corpora. To address this gap, we curate the largest
Tibetan pre-training corpus to date, aggregating data from diverse sources and
applying a dedicated data cleaning and processing pipeline tailored for
Tibetan. With the curated data, we continue pre/post-training a multilingual
base model into Banzhida, a multilingual large language model that advances
generative AI for Tibetan. To evaluate the Tibetan capabilities of the model,
we create new high-quality Tibetan benchmarks, and complement them with
existing public benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Banzhida
consistently and significantly outperforms both open-source models of similar
scale and Tibetan-tailored models across a wide range of tasks.

Conclusion: 视觉隐喻在气候变化传播中具有认知和美学优势，但需权衡其复杂性。

Abstract: Visual metaphors of climate change (e.g., melting glaciers depicted as a
melting ice grenade) are regarded as valuable tools for addressing the
complexity of environmental challenges. However, few studies have examined
their impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.
Here, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images
(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal
images and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of
difficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human
rating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the
message. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via
Natural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to
understand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not
differ in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was
higher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual
metaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the
image, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than
literal images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual
metaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper
cognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,
while they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem
to generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced
experience. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the impact of
visual metaphors of climate change both by offering a database for future
research and by elucidating a cost-benefit trade-off to take into account when
shaping environmental communication.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在幽默翻译中存在语言干扰和缺乏幽默感的问题，需要一种新方法来优化翻译质量。

Method: 采用心理学启发的幽默分解机制（HDM），结合思维链（CoT）模仿人类思维过程，并融入幽默理论增强幽默元素。

Result: 在开源幽默数据集上的实验显示，幽默翻译质量显著提升，幽默感、流畅性和连贯性分别平均提高了7.75%、2.81%和6.13%。

Conclusion: HDM方法有效解决了幽默翻译中的问题，为跨文化沟通提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Humour translation plays a vital role as a bridge between different cultures,
fostering understanding and communication. Although most existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) are capable of general translation tasks, these models
still struggle with humour translation, which is especially reflected through
linguistic interference and lacking humour in translated text. In this paper,
we propose a psychology-inspired Humour Decomposition Mechanism (HDM) that
utilises Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to imitate the ability of the human thought
process, stimulating LLMs to optimise the readability of translated humorous
texts. Moreover, we integrate humour theory in HDM to further enhance the
humorous elements in the translated text. Our automatic evaluation experiments
on open-source humour datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
improves the quality of humour translation, yielding average gains of 7.75\% in
humour, 2.81\% in fluency, and 6.13\% in coherence of the generated text.

Attribution Evaluation in Language Models), a unified benchmark for evaluating
data attribution methods through real-world LLM applications. DATE-LM measures
attribution quality through three key tasks -- training data selection,
toxicity/bias filtering, and factual attribution. Our benchmark is designed for
ease of use, enabling researchers to configure and run large-scale evaluations
across diverse tasks and LLM architectures. Furthermore, we use DATE-LM to
conduct a large-scale evaluation of existing data attribution methods. Our
findings show that no single method dominates across all tasks, data
attribution methods have trade-offs with simpler baselines, and method
performance is sensitive to task-specific evaluation design. Finally, we
release a public leaderboard for quick comparison of methods and to facilitate
community engagement. We hope DATE-LM serves as a foundation for future data
attribution research in LLMs.

*Mingchuan Yang,Ziyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 优化DRAGON Longformer模型用于临床文本分类，性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何优化预训练模型以适应临床文本分类任务，特别是医学案例描述的二元分类。

Method: 通过超参数调整、领域特定预处理和架构修改（如增加序列长度、调整学习率、延长训练周期和引入医学术语）优化模型。

Result: 优化后模型性能显著提升：准确率从72.0%提高到85.2%，其他指标（如精确率、召回率和F1分数）也有显著改善（p < .001）。

Conclusion: 优化模型在临床自然语言处理中表现优异，具有广泛医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for
clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification
of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing
structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100
for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained
joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter
tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key
modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens,
adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5
to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model
achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%,
precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from
71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these
improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in
interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical
observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model
research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language
processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across
diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in
healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems
that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented
approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both
strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how
advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then,
we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and
expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we
spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs
iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods,
datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper
RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive,
trustworthy, and human-centric. The collection is available at

Conclusion: ViSP能生成更高质量的讽刺内容，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form.
Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored,
primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of
visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent
in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm
generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic
text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation
framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive
learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of
sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor
outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation
quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate
ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including
large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.
Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual
Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts
exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity
(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic
content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Our dataset and code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法因短文本和小规模不平衡标注数据难以充分学习上下文信息，数据增强是可行策略但面临质量挑战。

Result: 在英文ABSA基准数据集上表现优于现有方法和基线模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的LLM结合强化学习的数据增强方法有效提升了ABSA任务的性能。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial fine-grained task in
social media scenarios to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspect
terms in a sentence. Although many existing studies leverage large language
models (LLMs) to perform ABSA due to their strong context understanding
capabilities, they still face challenges to learn the context information in
the running text because of the short text, as well as the small and unbalanced
labeled training data, where most data are labeled with positive sentiment.
Data augmentation (DA) is a feasible strategy for providing richer contextual
information, especially when using LLMs to create synthetic training data, but
faces challenges in ensuring a high quality of the augmented data.In this
paper, we propose an LLM-based ABSA approach with training data
augmentation.Specifically, an LLM is prompted to generate augmented training
data based on the original training data, so as to construct a new training
data with larger size and balanced label distributions to better train an ABSA
model. Meanwhile, in order to improve the quality of the augmented data, we
propose a reinforcement learning approach to optimize the data augmentation.
LLM.Experiment results and further analyses on English benchmark datasets for
ABSA demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, where superior performance
is observed over strong baselines and most existing studies.

TL;DR: GoalfyMax是一个协议驱动的多智能体协作框架，通过标准化通信和分层记忆系统提升智能体的协调性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单用途AI系统在复杂动态环境中缺乏协调性和记忆重用能力，限制了其扩展性。

Method: GoalfyMax基于Model Context Protocol（MCP）构建A2A通信层，结合Experience Pack（XP）分层记忆系统，支持多轮对话和动态安全验证。

Result: 实验证明GoalfyMax在复杂任务协调基准测试中优于基线框架，具有更高的适应性和协调性。

Conclusion: GoalfyMax为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的未来解决方案。

Abstract: Modern enterprise environments demand intelligent systems capable of handling
complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted tasks with high levels of autonomy and
adaptability. However, traditional single-purpose AI systems often lack
sufficient coordination, memory reuse, and task decomposition capabilities,
limiting their scalability in realistic settings. To address these challenges,
we present \textbf{GoalfyMax}, a protocol-driven framework for end-to-end
multi-agent collaboration. GoalfyMax introduces a standardized Agent-to-Agent
(A2A) communication layer built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
independent agents to coordinate through asynchronous, protocol-compliant
interactions. It incorporates the Experience Pack (XP) architecture, a layered
memory system that preserves both task rationales and execution traces,
enabling structured knowledge retention and continual learning. Moreover, our
system integrates advanced features including multi-turn contextual dialogue,
long-short term memory modules, and dynamic safety validation, supporting
robust, real-time strategy adaptation. Empirical results on complex task
orchestration benchmarks and case study demonstrate that GoalfyMax achieves
superior adaptability, coordination, and experience reuse compared to baseline
frameworks. These findings highlight its potential as a scalable, future-ready
foundation for multi-agent intelligent systems.

Motivation: 长上下文引用任务（LCLMs将兴趣项归因于长上下文数据的特定部分）尚未充分探索，需填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了Ref-Long基准，要求LCLMs识别引用特定关键词的文档索引，并构建了从合成到现实的三个子集。

Result: 实验显示13种LCLMs在长上下文引用任务中表现不佳，通过人类评估、任务格式调整等分析揭示了关键问题。

Conclusion: Ref-Long基准揭示了LCLMs在长上下文引用任务中的挑战，为未来研究提供了数据和代码支持。

Abstract: Long-context language models (LCLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
in long-context understanding tasks. Among these, long-context referencing -- a
crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific
parts of long-context data -- remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this
paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models
(Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing
capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the
indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual
relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on
the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic
scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs
reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among
advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we
conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format
adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several
key insights. Our data and code can be found in https://github.

Method: 系统评估不同错误类型和噪声水平对LLM性能的影响，包括定量分析和定性观察。

Result: 提示质量显著影响翻译性能，字符级和组合噪声比短语级噪声更严重；LLM在极端噪声下仍能翻译。

Conclusion: 提示质量对LLM性能至关重要，但不同噪声类型影响不同；LLM在极端噪声下仍具翻译能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved top results in recent machine
translation evaluations, but they are also known to be sensitive to errors and
perturbations in their prompts. We systematically evaluate how both humanly
plausible and synthetic errors in user prompts affect LLMs' performance on two
related tasks: Machine translation and machine translation evaluation. We
provide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the
models respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.
  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many
errors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without
errors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,
with character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than
phrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality
largely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting
translation quality itself. Further, LLMs can still translate in scenarios with
overwhelming random noise that would make the prompt illegible to humans.

experiments demonstrate that adapting a definition modeling systems requires
minimal amounts of data, but that there currently are gaps in what automatic
metrics do capture.

Motivation: 通用句子嵌入模型在金融领域的低资源语言（如韩语）中表现不佳，主要由于领域术语、语义时移和双语词汇不对齐等问题。

Method: 提出NMIXX模型，通过微调包含领域内同义句、硬负样本和精确韩英翻译的三元组数据，并发布KorFinSTS基准数据集。

Result: NMIXX在英语FinSTS和韩语KorFinSTS上分别提升Spearman's rho 0.10和0.22，优于其他基线模型，但通用STS性能略有下降。

Conclusion: NMIXX和KorFinSTS为金融领域的跨语言表示学习提供了有效工具，并强调了分词设计在低资源语言中的重要性。

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture
specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like
Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned
bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural
eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual
embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair
in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology,
and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a
1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research
reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks
miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual
bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and
+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing
other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in
general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer
Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of
tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models
and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust
tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Result: 案例研究表明SpreadPy能区分数学焦虑学生的知识结构、揭示认知负荷对词汇访问的影响，以及将网络结构与临床失语症错误类型关联。

Conclusion: SpreadPy为心理学、神经科学和教育研究提供了一个灵活且可复现的研究框架。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadPy as a Python library for simulating spreading activation
in cognitive single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tool is designed to
perform numerical simulations testing structure-function relationships in
cognitive processes. By comparing simulation results with grounded theories in
knowledge modelling, SpreadPy enables systematic investigations of how
activation dynamics reflect cognitive, psychological and clinical phenomena. We
demonstrate the library's utility through three case studies: (1) Spreading
activation on associative knowledge networks distinguishes students with high
versus low math anxiety, revealing anxiety-related structural differences in
conceptual organization; (2) Simulations of a creativity task show that
activation trajectories vary with task difficulty, exposing how cognitive load
modulates lexical access; (3) In individuals with aphasia, simulated activation
patterns on lexical networks correlate with empirical error types (semantic vs.
phonological) during picture-naming tasks, linking network structure to
clinical impairments. SpreadPy's flexible framework allows researchers to model
these processes using empirically derived or theoretical networks, providing
mechanistic insights into individual differences and cognitive impairments. The
library is openly available, supporting reproducible research in psychology,
neuroscience, and education research.

Abstract: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems' performance on Thai legal
question answering is still limited, especially for questions requiring
extensive, complex legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce
an approach aligning LLMs toward improved law citation accuracy and better
response quality using Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach
leverages BGE-M3 embeddings as a cost-efficient semantic-similarity reward,
significantly reducing computational expenses up to 2.5x compared to large

substantial improvements: GRPO achieves up to 90% citation-F1 gains from the
base model and a 31% increase in joint quality metrics over instruction tuning.
Crucially, our method shows enhanced robustness on complex legal reasoning
tasks compared to instruction tuning, providing an effective and

Motivation: 大型语言模型存在文化偏见和跨文化理解能力不足的问题，尤其在服务全球多样化用户时，需要系统性评估和改进。

Method: 提出MCEval框架，采用动态文化问题构建和反事实重述、混杂重述进行因果分析，评估文化意识和文化偏见。

Result: 实验结果显示性能差异与训练数据分布和语言-文化对齐相关，同时暴露了公平性问题。

Conclusion: MCEval是首个全面的多语言文化评估框架，为LLMs的文化理解提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit cultural biases and limited cross-cultural
understanding capabilities, particularly when serving diverse global user
populations. We propose MCEval, a novel multilingual evaluation framework that
employs dynamic cultural question construction and enables causal analysis
through Counterfactual Rephrasing and Confounder Rephrasing. Our comprehensive
evaluation spans 13 cultures and 13 languages, systematically assessing both
cultural awareness and cultural bias across different linguistic scenarios. The
framework provides 39,897 cultural awareness instances and 17,940 cultural bias
instances. Experimental results reveal performance disparities across different
linguistic scenarios, demonstrating that optimal cultural performance is not
only linked to training data distribution, but also is related to
language-culture alignment. The evaluation results also expose the fairness
issue, where approaches appearing successful in the English scenario create
substantial disadvantages. MCEval represents the first comprehensive
multilingual cultural evaluation framework that provides deeper insights into
LLMs' cultural understanding.

Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is
key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. \baturay{However,
it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations
related to semantic understanding. To investigate this, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study of hidden states in transformer-based LLMs,
analyzing 11 decoder-only models across 6 scientific topics and 12 layers each.
We find that high-level semantic information consistently lies in
low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across
distinct domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers
and under prompts that trigger structured reasoning or alignment
behaviors$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content is unchanged. This geometry
enables simple yet effective causal interventions in hidden space; for example,
reasoning patterns like chain-of-thought can be captured by a single vector
direction. Together, these findings support the development of geometry-aware
tools that operate directly on latent representations to detect and mitigate
harmful or adversarial content, using methods such as transport-based defenses
that leverage this separability. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate this
potential by training a simple MLP classifier as a lightweight latent-space
guardrail, which detects adversarial and malicious prompts with high precision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法依赖人工定义的难度指标，可能无法准确反映模型视角，需更自适应的策略。

Method: 基于预训练语言模型预测的难度分数，探索从易到难、从难到易及混合采样的训练策略。

Result: 在四个自然语言理解数据集上，该方法实现了更快收敛和性能提升。

Conclusion: 自适应的课程学习范式能有效提高模型训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a widely adopted training strategy in natural language
processing (NLP), where models are exposed to examples organized by increasing
difficulty to enhance learning efficiency and performance. However, most
existing approaches rely on manually defined difficulty metrics -- such as text
length -- which may not accurately reflect the model's own perspective. To
overcome this limitation, we present a self-adaptive curriculum learning
paradigm that prioritizes fine-tuning examples based on difficulty scores
predicted by pre-trained language models (PLMs) themselves. Building on these
scores, we explore various training strategies that differ in the ordering of
examples for the fine-tuning: from easy-to-hard, hard-to-easy, to mixed
sampling. We evaluate our method on four natural language understanding (NLU)
datasets covering both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
Experimental results show that our approach leads to faster convergence and
improved performance compared to standard random sampling.

### [245] [Te Ahorré Un Click: A Revised Definition of Clickbait and Detection in Spanish News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09777)
*Gabriel Mordecki,Guillermo Moncecchi,Javier Couto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文重新定义了点击诱饵（clickbait），提出其核心是通过制造好奇心缺口吸引点击，并发布了首个西班牙语点击诱饵检测开源数据集TA1C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对点击诱饵的定义缺乏共识，研究旨在明确其与类似现象的区别，并提出更客观的检测方法。

Method: 通过精确定义点击诱饵的概念和标注标准，创建了TA1C数据集，包含3,500条手动标注的推文，并实现了高准确率的基线模型。

Result: TA1C数据集达到0.825的Fleiss' K一致性评分，基线模型的F1分数为0.84。

Conclusion: 研究为点击诱饵检测提供了更清晰的定义和高质量数据集，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We revise the definition of clickbait, which lacks current consensus, and
argue that the creation of a curiosity gap is the key concept that
distinguishes clickbait from other related phenomena such as sensationalism and
headlines that do not deliver what they promise or diverge from the article.
Therefore, we propose a new definition: clickbait is a technique for generating
headlines and teasers that deliberately omit part of the information with the
goal of raising the readers' curiosity, capturing their attention and enticing
them to click. We introduce a new approach to clickbait detection datasets
creation, by refining the concept limits and annotations criteria, minimizing
the subjectivity in the decision as much as possible. Following it, we created
and release TA1C (for Te Ahorr\'e Un Click, Spanish for Saved You A Click), the
first open source dataset for clickbait detection in Spanish. It consists of
3,500 tweets coming from 18 well known media sources, manually annotated and
reaching a 0.825 Fleiss' K inter annotator agreement. We implement strong
baselines that achieve 0.84 in F1-score.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型通过上下文学习执行未见任务的能力，聚焦于‘加一’任务（如1+1=3），揭示了模型内部的功能归纳机制及其复用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何通过内部机制实现任务级泛化，尤其是对反事实任务（如‘加一’）的适应性。

Method: 使用路径修补等电路式解释性技术，分析模型在‘加一’任务中的内部计算。

Result: 发现功能归纳机制，类似先前研究的归纳头机制，且由多个注意力头并行控制；该机制还可复用于其他任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中可复用和可组合的结构如何支持任务级泛化，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen
tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms
inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we
approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,
2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function
as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as
path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their
notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a
function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from
standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the
structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it
to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1
function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which
emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function
induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic
tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8
addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and
composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的RAG框架，通过分层文本分割和聚类生成更有语义意义的文本块，提升了检索的精确性和上下文相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分块方法未能充分捕捉语义信息，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 结合分层文本分割和聚类，生成更语义连贯的文本块，并在推理时利用分段和聚类级别的向量表示。

Result: 在NarrativeQA、QuALITY和QASPER数据集上表现优于传统分块方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了RAG系统的检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies
for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to
access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is
up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to
create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account
for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework
that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering
to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference,
the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and
cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of
retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on
the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method
achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Motivation: 大型解码器语言模型在RLHF中占主导，但推理成本高，需更高效的替代方案。

Result: TinyRM在推理和安全性偏好建模任务中表现优异，资源消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: 小模型结合特定领域调优策略，有望成为高效、可扩展的偏好建模替代方案。

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for
reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However,
as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their
inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small,
bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million
parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on
reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style
prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to
achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer
resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from
domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight
finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in
building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our
preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional
architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

TL;DR: TextOmics是一个开创性基准，通过建立组学表达与分子文本描述的一一对应关系，为靶向药物发现提供异构数据和统一框架。提出的ToDi生成框架结合组学和文本描述，生成生物相关、化学有效的分子，优于现有方法。

Motivation: 解决靶向药物发现中异构数据缺乏和统一框架不足的问题。

Result: 实验证实TextOmics有效性，ToDi优于现有方法，并在零样本治疗分子生成中表现突出。

Conclusion: TextOmics和ToDi为靶向药物发现提供了高效工具，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Hit-like molecular generation with therapeutic potential is essential for
target-specific drug discovery. However, the field lacks heterogeneous data and
unified frameworks for integrating diverse molecular representations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce TextOmics, a pioneering benchmark that establishes
one-to-one correspondences between omics expressions and molecular textual
descriptions. TextOmics provides a heterogeneous dataset that facilitates
molecular generation through representations alignment. Built upon this
foundation, we propose ToDi, a generative framework that jointly conditions on
omics expressions and molecular textual descriptions to produce biologically
relevant, chemically valid, hit-like molecules. ToDi leverages two encoders
(OmicsEn and TextEn) to capture multi-level biological and semantic
associations, and develops conditional diffusion (DiffGen) for controllable
generation. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of TextOmics and
demonstrate ToDi outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, while also
showcasing remarkable potential in zero-shot therapeutic molecular generation.

*Jun Li,Xiangmeng Wang,Haoyang Li,Yifei Yan,Hong Va Leong,Ling Feng,Nancy Xiaonan Yu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，通过联合学习风险因素和保护因素对自杀风险的动态影响，预测后续自杀风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注风险因素，忽视保护因素，且无法捕捉自杀风险的快速波动。

Method: 构建了一个包含风险和保护因素的数据集，并提出动态因素影响学习方法。

Result: 模型在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并提供可解释的权重。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床干预提供了更精准和可解释的工具。

Abstract: Suicide is a critical global health issue that requires urgent attention.
Even though prior work has revealed valuable insights into detecting current
suicide risk on social media, little attention has been paid to developing
models that can predict subsequent suicide risk over time, limiting their
ability to capture rapid fluctuations in individuals' mental state transitions.
In addition, existing work ignores protective factors that play a crucial role
in suicide risk prediction, focusing predominantly on risk factors alone.
Protective factors such as social support and coping strategies can mitigate
suicide risk by moderating the impact of risk factors. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly
learning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on
users' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware
Dataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive
annotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also
introduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the
varying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,
recognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established
psychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language
models across three datasets. In addition, the proposed Dynamic Factors
Influence Learning provides interpretable weights, helping clinicians better
understand suicidal patterns and enabling more targeted intervention
strategies.

TL;DR: GeLaCo是一种基于进化算法的LLM压缩方法，通过层折叠和模块相似性评估，高效探索压缩解空间，支持单目标和多目标优化，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）计算需求高，部署和使用受限，模型压缩是解决这一问题的关键。现有方法如结构化剪枝成本高且可能忽略更优解。

Method: GeLaCo采用进化算法，通过层折叠和模块相似性（注意力、前馈网络和隐藏状态表示）评估，支持单目标和多目标压缩搜索。

Result: GeLaCo在基础模型和指令调优模型上，通过困惑度和生成评估，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeLaCo为LLM压缩提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案，首次建立了压缩与质量的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a
large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to
substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to
reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to
mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as
structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal
variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we
introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer
collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression
solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness
function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations.
GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression
search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality
axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative
evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming
state-of-the-art alternatives.

*Simon Münker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在文化道德多样性上表现不足，无法准确代表人类多样化的道德直觉，且模型规模的增加并未改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能真正代表人类多样化的道德价值观，而非简单地平均化处理。

Method: 通过应用道德基础问卷（Moral Foundations Questionnaire）在19种文化背景下比较LLMs与人类道德直觉的差异。

Result: LLMs在道德多样性上表现不足，模型规模的增加未能显著改善文化代表性。

Conclusion: 当前AI对齐方法存在根本性局限，需开发更贴近实际的对齐目标和评估指标，以确保AI系统能代表多样化的人类价值观。

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across
them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs)
fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic
capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral
intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural
contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human
baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity.
Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural
representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as
synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental
limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment
beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific
moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and
evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather
than flattening the moral landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ReFT方法在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，因为固定位置的表示对输出影响不明确。研究发现关键表示对推理性能有显著影响，因此提出CRFT方法。

Method: CRFT通过信息流分析识别关键表示，并在低秩线性子空间中动态优化这些表示，同时冻结基础模型。

Result: 在八个算术和常识推理基准测试中验证了CRFT的有效性和高效性，单次准确率提升16.4%。

Conclusion: CRFT展示了表示级优化在推理任务中的潜力，为传统PEFT方法提供了轻量且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly
improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this
work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,
directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at
the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these
fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe
that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical
representations. These representations either integrate significant information
from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through
layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final
output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential
to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we
propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that
identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information
flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,
dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace
while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method
are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,
using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts
effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work
highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT
reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间序列预测中表现不佳，而普通Transformer难以学习高级语义模式，因此需要结合两者优势。

Method: 设计了一种新型Transformer架构，融合LLMs的语义表示和普通Transformer的时间信息。

Result: 实验证明该模型在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和Transformer的架构能有效提升时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in performing various tasks and thus are applied by recent studies
to time series forecasting (TSF) tasks, which predict future values with the
given historical time series. Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge
learned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning
strategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and
semantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical
time series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to
achieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly
trained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn
high-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel
Transformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla
Transformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations
learned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series
Transformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the
representations from the LLM and the Transformer. The resulting fused
representation contains both historical temporal dynamics and semantic
variation patterns, allowing our model to predict more accurate future values.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外参数的任务特征蒸馏方法，解决传统特征蒸馏方法中师生模型隐藏层尺寸不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法要求师生模型隐藏层尺寸相同，限制了学生模型的灵活性。线性投影方法虽能解决尺寸不匹配问题，但会引入额外参数并降低性能。

Method: 通过识别教师模型中与任务最相关的隐藏单元，直接将其激活蒸馏到学生模型，无需引入新参数。

Result: 在分类、指令跟随和摘要等任务中，性能比线性投影基线提升高达3%。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，适用于不同任务，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular
are promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large
language models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically
assume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting
the flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this
problem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but
this introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and
often degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative
settings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based
feature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and
student models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any
new parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components
contribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies
the most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their
activations to the student. Our method is flexible and easily integrates with
other distillation frameworks. Empirical results show consistent improvements
over prior approaches across diverse tasks, including classification,
instruction-following, and summarization, achieving up to a 3\% performance
gain over the linear projection baseline.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但其在识别和转换侮辱性文本方面的能力仍需探索。

Method: 使用LLMs转换包含仇恨言论和脏话的文本，保持原意但去除侮辱性内容，并通过情感和语义分析评估效果。

Result: Groq的表现与其他模型差异显著，而GPT-4o与DeepSeek-V3表现相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在侮辱性文本转换中表现不一，Groq与其他模型差异明显。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the
classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions
remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform
abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into
non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the
performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and
Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and
obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but
maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text
needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed
datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq
provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have
identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly central to Arabic NLP
applications, evaluating their understanding of regional dialects and cultural
nuances is essential, particularly in linguistically diverse settings like
Saudi Arabia. This paper introduces \texttt{Absher}, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to assess LLMs performance across major Saudi dialects.
\texttt{Absher} comprises over 18,000 multiple-choice questions spanning six
distinct categories: Meaning, True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank, Contextual Usage,
Cultural Interpretation, and Location Recognition. These questions are derived
from a curated dataset of dialectal words, phrases, and proverbs sourced from
various regions of Saudi Arabia. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs,
including multilingual and Arabic-specific models. We also provide detailed
insights into their capabilities and limitations. Our results reveal notable
performance gaps, particularly in tasks requiring cultural inference or
contextual understanding. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
dialect-aware training and culturally aligned evaluation methodologies to
improve LLMs performance in real-world Arabic applications.

Result: 在三个小型LLMs和四个复杂任务上优于PromptWizard、OPRO和RL-Prompt。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂任务和小型LLMs上表现优异，性能退化最小。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has proven to be a crucial step in leveraging pretrained
large language models (LLMs) in solving various real-world tasks. Numerous
solutions have been proposed that seek to automate prompt engineering by using
the model itself to edit prompts. However, the majority of state-of-the-art
approaches are evaluated on tasks that require minimal prompt templates and on
very large and highly capable LLMs. In contrast, solving complex tasks that
require detailed information to be included in the prompt increases the amount
of text that needs to be optimised. Furthermore, smaller models have been shown
to be more sensitive to prompt design. To address these challenges, we propose
an evolutionary search approach to automated discrete prompt optimisation
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, grammar-guided genetic
programming is invoked to synthesise prompt-creating programmes by searching
the space of programmes populated by function compositions of syntactic,
dictionary-based and LLM-based prompt-editing functions. In the second phase,
local search is applied to explore the neighbourhoods of best-performing
programmes in an attempt to further fine-tune their performance. Our approach
outperforms three state-of-the-art prompt optimisation approaches,
PromptWizard, OPRO, and RL-Prompt, on three relatively small general-purpose
LLMs in four domain-specific challenging tasks. We also illustrate several
examples where these benchmark methods suffer relatively severe performance
degradation, while our approach improves performance in almost all task-model
combinations, only incurring minimal degradation when it does not.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Growth Bound Matrices（GBM）的新正则化技术，用于提升NLP模型对抗词替换攻击的鲁棒性，并在LSTM、S4和CNN架构上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLP领域取得了进展，但模型仍容易受到对抗攻击（如同义词替换）。现有研究多关注前馈和卷积架构的鲁棒性，而对循环网络和现代状态空间模型（如S4）的研究较少。这些架构因其顺序处理和复杂参数动态性带来独特挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于GBM的正则化技术，通过减少输入扰动对模型输出的影响来提升鲁棒性。该方法在LSTM、S4和CNN三种架构上进行了验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在对抗鲁棒性上比现有基线提升了8.8%，并在对抗防御任务中优于多种先进方法。

Conclusion: GBM方法有效提升了NLP模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，尤其是在LSTM、S4和CNN架构上表现突出，为SSM（S4）的鲁棒性提供了首次系统性分析。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)

8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our

*Rosa Illan Castillo,Javier Valenzuela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在语言学研究中作为可靠分析工具的潜力，特别是在涉及运动动词的时间表达中情感意义的生成。通过四项心理语言学实验，研究发现人类与AI的反应高度一致，表明LLM可以作为人类实验的有力补充。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于验证LLM（如GPT-4）是否能复现人类在语言学任务中的细微判断，以评估其作为研究工具的可靠性。

Method: 方法包括四项心理语言学实验（情感意义生成、情感变化、情感语境中的动词选择、句子-表情符号关联），分别在人类和LLM上重复进行。

Result: 结果显示人类与AI的反应高度一致（Spearman's rho = .73-.96），仅在少数情况下存在微小差异，但不影响整体解释。

Conclusion: 结论支持LLM作为语言学研究中可信赖的协作工具，能够扩展研究规模且不损害解释有效性。

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) as reliable
analytical tools in linguistic research, focusing on the emergence of affective
meanings in temporal expressions involving manner-of-motion verbs. While LLMs
like GPT-4 have shown promise across a range of tasks, their ability to
replicate nuanced human judgements remains under scrutiny. We conducted four
psycholinguistic studies (on emergent meanings, valence shifts, verb choice in
emotional contexts, and sentence-emoji associations) first with human
participants and then replicated the same tasks using an LLM. Results across
all studies show a striking convergence between human and AI responses, with
statistical analyses (e.g., Spearman's rho = .73-.96) indicating strong
correlations in both rating patterns and categorical choices. While minor
divergences were observed in some cases, these did not alter the overall
interpretative outcomes. These findings offer compelling evidence that LLMs can
augment traditional human-based experimentation, enabling broader-scale studies
without compromising interpretative validity. This convergence not only
strengthens the empirical foundation of prior human-based findings but also
opens possibilities for hypothesis generation and data expansion through AI.
Ultimately, our study supports the use of LLMs as credible and informative
collaborators in linguistic inquiry.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层的隐喻处理模型，将意义分为内容分析、概念融合和语用意图三个层次，为计算系统提供了更丰富的隐喻解释框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻意义不是简单的概念映射，而是一个复杂的认知现象，需要多层次的解释。

Method: 提出三层模型：内容分析、概念融合和语用意图，逐步处理隐喻的各个层面。

Result: 模型为计算系统提供了更深入、更上下文敏感的隐喻理解方法。

Conclusion: 该分层框架为隐喻的计算表示奠定了基础，超越了表面关联，实现了更深层次的理解。

Abstract: Metaphorical meaning is not a flat mapping between concepts, but a complex
cognitive phenomenon that integrates multiple levels of interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a stratified model of metaphor processing that treats meaning
as an onion: a multi-layered structure comprising (1) content analysis, (2)
conceptual blending, and (3) pragmatic intentionality. This three-dimensional
framework allows for a richer and more cognitively grounded approach to
metaphor interpretation in computational systems. At the first level, metaphors
are annotated through basic conceptual elements. At the second level, we model
conceptual combinations, linking components to emergent meanings. Finally, at
the third level, we introduce a pragmatic vocabulary to capture speaker intent,
communicative function, and contextual effects, aligning metaphor understanding
with pragmatic theories. By unifying these layers into a single formal
framework, our model lays the groundwork for computational methods capable of
representing metaphorical meaning beyond surface associations, toward deeper,
more context-sensitive reasoning.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何通过解码器Transformer架构理解图结构，并探索其在子结构提取任务中的内部机制。

Method: 提出诱导子结构过滤（ISF）视角，结合实证和理论分析，验证其在LLMs中的一致性动态。

Result: 发现解码器Transformer能够成功提取属性图（如分子图）中的子结构，并展示其在处理复杂复合模式时的能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了序列Transformer在图数据子结构提取任务中的新机制，为理解其能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the
capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures
are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer
related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only
Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address
this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner
mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input
queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,
we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures
the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further
validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across
layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of
Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the
concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite
patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully
extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.
Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers
perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLMs在任务导向对话中提出澄清问题的能力，发现人类和LLMs在模糊性处理上表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在异步任务对话中提出澄清问题的能力及其与人类行为的差异。

Method: 结合现有Minecraft Dialogue Corpus的注释，构建新语料库，比较人类和LLMs在模糊性情况下的行为。

Result: 人类很少因指代模糊提问，而LLMs更频繁；人类更关注任务不确定性，LLMs则相反。推理能力提升LLMs提问的频率和相关性。

Conclusion: LLMs的澄清提问能力可能依赖于其推理能力，但与人类行为存在显著差异。

Abstract: In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统招聘流程在简历筛选和候选人匹配上存在时间和资源瓶颈，MLAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MLAR采用三层LLM处理：提取职位关键特征、解析简历信息、语义匹配候选人。

Result: MLAR在2400份简历处理中，平均每份耗时5.4秒，比主流RPA平台快16.9%-17.1%。

Conclusion: MLAR为现代招聘需求提供了高效、准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Applicant Tracking System (ATS) enhanced
by a novel Robotic process automation (RPA) framework or as further referred to
as MLAR. Traditional recruitment processes often encounter bottlenecks in
resume screening and candidate shortlisting due to time and resource
constraints. MLAR addresses these challenges employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) in three distinct layers: extracting key characteristics from job
postings in the first layer, parsing applicant resume to identify education,
experience, skills in the second layer, and similarity matching in the third
layer. These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to
identify the best candidates efficiently. Our approach integrates seamlessly
into existing RPA pipelines, automating resume parsing, job matching, and
candidate notifications. Extensive performance benchmarking shows that MLAR
outperforms the leading RPA platforms, including UiPath and Automation
Anywhere, in high-volume resume-processing tasks. When processing 2,400
resumes, MLAR achieved an average processing time of 5.4 seconds per resume,
reducing processing time by approximately 16.9% compared to Automation Anywhere
and 17.1% compared to UiPath. These results highlight the potential of MLAR to
transform recruitment workflows by providing an efficient, accurate, and
scalable solution tailored to modern hiring needs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展引发了对AI生成文本检测的担忧，现有方法对扩散生成文本的检测效果未知。

Method: 使用2000个样本，系统比较了LLaDA和LLaMA生成文本的困惑度、突发性、词汇多样性、可读性及BLEU/ROUGE分数。

Result: LLaDA在困惑度和突发性上更接近人类文本，导致检测器高假阴性率；LLaMA困惑度低但词汇保真度差。单一指标无法区分扩散生成文本和人类文本。

Conclusion: 需开发扩散感知检测方法，如混合模型、扩散特定风格特征和鲁棒水印技术。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns
about reliably detecting AI-generated text. Stylometric metrics work well on
autoregressive (AR) outputs, but their effectiveness on diffusion-based models
is unknown. We present the first systematic comparison of diffusion-generated
text (LLaDA) and AR-generated text (LLaMA) using 2 000 samples. Perplexity,
burstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that
LLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high
false-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower
perplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to
separate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for
diffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,
diffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只关注参数共享或自适应计算，未能同时实现两者，MoR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MoR通过共享层堆栈和轻量级路由器实现参数效率和自适应计算，动态分配递归深度，并选择性缓存关键值对。

Result: 在135M到1.7B参数的模型规模下，MoR显著降低验证困惑度，提高少样本准确率，并提升吞吐量。

Conclusion: MoR是一种在不增加大模型成本的情况下实现高质量模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying
computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive.
Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or
adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both
simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework
that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.
MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter
efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by
dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This
allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still
active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency
by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core
mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the
first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory
footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms
a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it
significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,
while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive
baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards
large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

Motivation: 现有LLM作为裁判的范式在代码任务中缺乏专门基准，其有效性和可靠性尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入CodeJudgeBench基准，评估26个LLM裁判模型在代码生成、修复和单元测试生成任务中的表现。

Result: 思维模型显著优于非思维模型，但裁判结果受响应顺序和内容影响，存在随机性。

Conclusion: LLM作为裁判在代码任务中表现不稳定，需优化提示策略以提高可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art
in various coding tasks. Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also
serve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by
other models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking
different LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.
However, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its
effectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of
dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a
benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge
models across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and
unit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge
models, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform
non-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even
relatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially
trained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still
exhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise
judging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can
substantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests
written by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in
performance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and
consistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal
prompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise
comparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining
comments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved
judge performance.

Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单问题推理，无法反映真实世界的多上下文压力需求。

Result: SOTA模型在压力测试下表现显著下降，REST显示出更强的区分能力。

Conclusion: REST是一种高效、面向未来的评估范式，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by
isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess
single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical
limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging
(e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly and perpetual
creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate
models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world
deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through
Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that concurrently exposes
LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST
specifically evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority
allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load
management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance
degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger
discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance
differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under
single-question evaluations. Some key mechanistic insights emerge from our
analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the
performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique
preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST,
outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a
cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects
real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human
annotation.

*Josh Qixuan Sun,Xiaoying Xing,Huaiyuan Weng,Chul Min Yeum,Mark Crowley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIL（View Invariant Learning）的后训练策略，用于增强视觉语言导航（VLNCE）策略对相机视角变化的鲁棒性。通过对比学习和师生框架，VIL显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航策略对相机视角变化敏感，影响了导航性能。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了V2-VLNCE场景和VIL方法。

Method: VIL采用对比学习框架提取稀疏且视角不变的特征，并通过师生框架优化Waypoint Predictor Module。采用端到端训练范式联合优化各组件。

Result: 在V2-VLNCE场景下，VIL在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的成功率比现有方法提高了8-15%。在标准VLNCE设置下，性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: VIL不仅提升了视角变化的鲁棒性，还保持了标准视角下的性能，可作为即插即用的后训练方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent
follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research
problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to
viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that
alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized
scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View
Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the
robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL
employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant
features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the
Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a
view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student
model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these
components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets
R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE
setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often
still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method
also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to
other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the
standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training
method.

Abstract: The combination of highly realistic voice cloning, along with visually
compelling avatar, face-swap, or lip-sync deepfake video generation, makes it

deepfake impersonations are often used to power frauds, scams, and political
disinformation. We propose a novel forensic machine learning technique for the
detection of deepfake video impersonations that leverages unnatural patterns in
facial biometrics. We evaluate this technique across a large dataset of
deepfake techniques and impersonations, as well as assess its reliability to
video laundering and its generalization to previously unseen video deepfake
generators.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）常因训练数据中的偏差而产生预测偏差，PRISM旨在无需预定义偏差类别或外部数据的情况下解决这一问题。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1）用LLM生成包含虚假相关性的场景描述；2）使用对比性去偏损失学习投影，最小化虚假相关性并保持嵌入对齐。

Result: PRISM在Waterbirds和CelebA数据集上优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: PRISM提供了一种高效的去偏解决方案，适用于多种任务，且无需额外数据。

Abstract: We introduce Projection-based Reduction of Implicit Spurious bias in
vision-language Models (PRISM), a new data-free and task-agnostic solution for
bias mitigation in VLMs like CLIP. VLMs often inherit and amplify biases in
their training data, leading to skewed predictions. PRISM is designed to debias
VLMs without relying on predefined bias categories or additional external data.
It operates in two stages: first, an LLM is prompted with simple class prompts
to generate scene descriptions that contain spurious correlations. Next, PRISM
uses our novel contrastive-style debiasing loss to learn a projection that maps
the embeddings onto a latent space that minimizes spurious correlations while
preserving the alignment between image and text embeddings.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRISM outperforms current debiasing methods on the
commonly used Waterbirds and CelebA datasets We make our code public at:

Conclusion: HMR-ViT通过结合时空和运动学信息，实现了更准确的人体网格恢复。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from an image is a challenging problem because of
the inherent ambiguity of the task. Existing HMR methods utilized either
temporal information or kinematic relationships to achieve higher accuracy, but
there is no method using both. Hence, we propose "Video Inference for Human
Mesh Recovery with Vision Transformer (HMR-ViT)" that can take into account
both temporal and kinematic information. In HMR-ViT, a Temporal-kinematic
Feature Image is constructed using feature vectors obtained from video frames
by an image encoder. When generating the feature image, we use a Channel
Rearranging Matrix (CRM) so that similar kinematic features could be located
spatially close together. The feature image is then further encoded using
Vision Transformer, and the SMPL pose and shape parameters are finally inferred
using a regression network. Extensive evaluation on the 3DPW and Human3.6M
datasets indicates that our method achieves a competitive performance in HMR.

Conclusion: 该方法为颗粒材料特性表征提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
with Material Point Method (MPM) simulation to infer granular material
properties from visual observations. Our approach begins by generating
synthetic experimental data, simulating an plow interacting with sand. The
experiment is rendered into realistic images as the photographic observations.
These observations include multi-view images of the experiment's initial state
and time-sequenced images from two fixed cameras. Using NeRF, we reconstruct
the 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability
to synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The
reconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for
the MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown. We render images
of the simulation under the same camera setup and compare them to the observed
images. By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to
estimate the best-fitting friction angle. Our results demonstrate that friction
angle can be estimated with an error within 2 degrees, highlighting the
effectiveness of inverse analysis through purely visual observations. This
approach offers a promising solution for characterizing granular materials in
real-world scenarios where direct measurement is impractical or impossible.

*Xiwei Xuan,Xiaoqi Wang,Wenbin He,Jorge Piazentin Ono,Liang Gou,Kwan-Liu Ma,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一个视觉分析框架，旨在提升多模态基础模型生成标签的质量，通过结合多阶段数据验证策略和人类专业知识，解决现有方法在数据质量评估上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注数据量而非质量，且缺乏全面评估FM生成标签质量的工具，导致在开放词汇图像分割等任务中性能受限。

Method: VISTA整合多阶段数据验证策略与人类专业知识，帮助识别和修正FM生成标签中的潜在问题。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的详细案例和专家评审表明，VISTA在定量和定性上均有效提升了数据质量。

Conclusion: VISTA通过提升数据质量，显著增强了多模态模型在开放词汇图像分割等任务中的性能。

Abstract: The advances in multi-modal foundation models (FMs) (e.g., CLIP and LLaVA)
have facilitated the auto-labeling of large-scale datasets, enhancing model
performance in challenging downstream tasks such as open-vocabulary object
detection and segmentation. However, the quality of FM-generated labels is less
studied as existing approaches focus more on data quantity over quality. This
is because validating large volumes of data without ground truth presents a
considerable challenge in practice. Existing methods typically rely on limited
metrics to identify problematic data, lacking a comprehensive perspective, or
apply human validation to only a small data fraction, failing to address the
full spectrum of potential issues. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VISTA, a visual analytics framework that improves data quality to enhance the
performance of multi-modal models. Targeting the complex and demanding domain
of open-vocabulary image segmentation, VISTA integrates multi-phased data
validation strategies with human expertise, enabling humans to identify,
understand, and correct hidden issues within FM-generated labels. Through
detailed use cases on two benchmark datasets and expert reviews, we demonstrate
VISTA's effectiveness from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种对比损失函数，用于解决类别不平衡扩散模型中尾部类别图像多样性不足的问题，同时保持头部类别的保真度和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡数据导致尾部类别图像合成多样性降低，模式崩溃。目标是提升尾部类别多样性，同时不影响头部类别。

Method: 引入两种对比损失函数：无监督InfoNCE损失和MSE损失，通过对比条件与非条件生成增强尾部类别多样性。

Result: 方法在多个数据集（如CIFAR10/100-LT等）上优于标准DDPM和其他替代方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架简单有效，首次将条件-非条件对齐应用于扩散模型，显著提升尾部类别多样性。

Abstract: Training data for class-conditional image synthesis often exhibit a
long-tailed distribution with limited images for tail classes. Such an
imbalance causes mode collapse and reduces the diversity of synthesized images
for tail classes. For class-conditional diffusion models trained on imbalanced
data, we aim to improve the diversity of tail class images without compromising
the fidelity and diversity of head class images. We achieve this by introducing
two deceptively simple but highly effective contrastive loss functions.
Firstly, we employ an unsupervised InfoNCE loss utilizing negative samples to
increase the distance/dissimilarity among synthetic images, particularly for
tail classes. To further enhance the diversity of tail classes, our second loss
is an MSE loss that contrasts class-conditional generation with unconditional
generation at large timesteps. This second loss makes the denoising process
insensitive to class conditions for the initial steps, which enriches tail
classes through knowledge sharing from head classes. Conditional-unconditional
alignment has been shown to enhance the performance of long-tailed GAN. We are
the first to adapt such alignment to diffusion models. We successfully
leveraged contrastive learning for class-imbalanced diffusion models. Our
contrastive learning framework is easy to implement and outperforms standard
DDPM and alternative methods for class-imbalanced diffusion models across
various datasets, including CIFAR10/100-LT, PlacesLT, TinyImageNetLT, and
ImageNetLT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在处理长时间视频时面临计算、内存和时序一致性的挑战，需要新的研究方向以突破这些限制。

Method: 提出‘无限视频理解’概念，并建议从流式架构、持久内存机制、分层表示等方面进行研究。

Result: 论文未提供具体实验结果，但指出了实现无限视频理解的关键挑战和方向。

Conclusion: 无限视频理解是一个有潜力的研究方向，可为多媒体和AI领域带来创新突破。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.
However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and
comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent
efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for
extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and
VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive
contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant
computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual
tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,
tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended
periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning
systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,
albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video
Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,
and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We
argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research
objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,
research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming
architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive
representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.
Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and
several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research
directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

*Tharun Adithya Srikrishnan,Deval Shah,Steven K. Reinhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlindSight是一种无需训练的方法，通过利用注意力稀疏性优化大型视觉语言模型（VLM）的推理效率，减少计算量（FLOPs）同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据的加入显著增加了提示长度和注意力计算的复杂性，导致推理时间延长。

Method: 分析VLM中的注意力模式，提出基于输入模板的注意力稀疏掩码（BlindSight），并利用数据集样本为每个注意力头分类稀疏性。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL等模型上，BlindSight平均减少32%-41%的FLOPs，准确性变化在-2%到+2%之间。

Conclusion: BlindSight有效优化了VLM的推理效率，适用于多图像理解任务。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable the joint processing of text and
images. However, the inclusion of vision data significantly expands the prompt
length. Along with the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, this
results in a longer prefill duration. An approach to mitigate this bottleneck
is to leverage the inherent sparsity in the attention computation. In our
analysis of attention patterns in VLMs, we observe that a substantial portion
of layers exhibit minimal cross-image attention, except through attention-sink
tokens per image. These sparse attention patterns fall into distinct
categories: sink-only, document mask and a hybrid document-sink mask. Based on
this, we propose BlindSight: a training-free approach to optimize VLM inference
using a input template-aware attention sparsity mask. We utilize samples from a
dataset to derive a prompt-agnostic sparsity categorization for every attention
head. We evaluate the proposed technique using VLMs such as Qwen2-VL,
Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3. BlindSight results in a 32%-41% reduction in FLOPs on
average with -2%-+2% accuracy compared to the original model in most evaluated
multi-image understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: 展望了下一代基础模型的发展，强调统一建模能力、跨领域泛化和物理可解释性。

Abstract: Quantitative remote sensing inversion aims to estimate continuous surface
variables-such as biomass, vegetation indices, and evapotranspiration-from
satellite observations, supporting applications in ecosystem monitoring, carbon
accounting, and land management. With the evolution of remote sensing systems
and artificial intelligence, traditional physics-based paradigms are giving way
to data-driven and foundation model (FM)-based approaches. This paper
systematically reviews the methodological evolution of inversion techniques,
from physical models (e.g., PROSPECT, SCOPE, DART) to machine learning methods
(e.g., deep learning, multimodal fusion), and further to foundation models
(e.g., SatMAE, GFM, mmEarth). We compare the modeling assumptions, application
scenarios, and limitations of each paradigm, with emphasis on recent FM
advances in self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal integration, and
cross-task adaptation. We also highlight persistent challenges in physical
interpretability, domain generalization, limited supervision, and uncertainty
quantification. Finally, we envision the development of next-generation
foundation models for remote sensing inversion, emphasizing unified modeling
capacity, cross-domain generalization, and physical interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光流提取是计算机视觉的核心问题，但现有方法需要微调且标签稀缺。本文探索是否可以通过提示冻结的自监督视频模型直接提取光流。

Method: 基于Counterfactual World Model范式，提出KL-tracing技术，通过注入扰动并跟踪其传播来提取光流，特别适用于LRAS架构。

Result: 在TAP-Vid DAVIS和Kubric数据集上，无需微调即超越现有最优模型（分别提升16.6%和4.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示可控生成视频模型是一种高效且可扩展的光流提取方法，优于监督或光度损失方法。

Abstract: Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.
Motivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen
self-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be
prompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or
illumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical
for flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a
sim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,
which can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer
perturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we
extend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular
architectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner
is aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future
frames (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat
each spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that
can condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely
present in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.
Building on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that
injects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one
step, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and
unperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS
dataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid
Kubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual
prompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective
alternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.

Motivation: 随着机器视觉在医疗和自动化电厂等关键领域的应用增加，理解卷积神经网络的内部机制及其推理原因变得至关重要。

Method: MI CAM通过互信息加权特征图，生成显著性可视化，并通过线性组合权重和激活图生成最终结果。

Result: MI CAM在定性和定量指标上均优于现有方法，并通过反事实分析验证了其因果解释能力。

Conclusion: MI CAM提供了一种有效的视觉解释方法，能够展示模型推理过程的公正性和性能。

Abstract: With the intervention of machine vision in our crucial day to day necessities
including healthcare and automated power plants, attention has been drawn to
the internal mechanisms of convolutional neural networks, and the reason why
the network provides specific inferences. This paper proposes a novel post-hoc
visual explanation method called MI CAM based on activation mapping. Differing
from previous class activation mapping based approaches, MI CAM produces
saliency visualizations by weighing each feature map through its mutual
information with the input image and the final result is generated by a linear
combination of weights and activation maps. It also adheres to producing causal
interpretations as validated with the help of counterfactual analysis. We aim
to exhibit the visual performance and unbiased justifications for the model
inferencing procedure achieved by MI CAM. Our approach works at par with all
state-of-the-art methods but particularly outperforms some in terms of
qualitative and quantitative measures. The implementation of proposed method
can be found on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MI-CAM-4D27

TL;DR: RadEyeVideo通过整合放射科医生的眼动视频序列，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在胸部X光分析和疾病诊断中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了眼动顺序的潜在价值，RadEyeVideo旨在通过捕捉眼动的时空动态来增强模型性能。

Method: 提出RadEyeVideo方法，将眼动数据以视频序列形式输入到支持视频的LVLMs中，用于胸部X光报告生成和疾病诊断。

Result: 模型性能在报告生成任务中提升24.6%，两项任务平均提升15.2%，甚至超越专业医学LVLMs。

Conclusion: RadEyeVideo展示了专家知识与通用模型的结合潜力，为医学图像分析提供了一种可扩展的人本方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance
in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several
studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or
textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of
eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the
areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we
propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists'
eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial
dynamics of their gaze. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and
disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with video
input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance
improves by up to 24.6% in the report generation task and on average 15.2% for
both tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Notably, RadEyeVideo enhanced an
open-domain LVLM model, LLaVA-OneVision, to surpass task-specific medical LVLMs
such as MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, trained on large Chest X-ray data. This work
highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case),
when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance
general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks. RadEyeVideo is a step
toward a scalable human-centered approach of utilizing LVLMs in medical image
analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型受限于小规模数据集，而SD模型在大规模数据上表现优异，因此探索如何利用SD提升3D自监督学习。

Method: 提出PointSD框架，将SD的文本编码器替换为3D编码器，训练点云引导的图像去噪模型，并提取SD特征对齐3D主干网络。

Result: 实验表明，SD模型能有效提升点云自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: PointSD成功利用SD模型的强大能力，为3D表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models, widely used in text-to-image generation, have proven
effective in 2D representation learning. Recently, this framework has been
extended to 3D self-supervised learning by constructing a conditional point
generator for enhancing 3D representations. However, its performance remains
constrained by the 3D diffusion model, which is trained on the available 3D
datasets with limited size. We hypothesize that the robust capabilities of
text-to-image diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion (SD), which is
trained on large-scale datasets, can help overcome these limitations. To
investigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the
SD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text
encoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that
allows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the
trained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input
and point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D
backbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating
direct semantic learning. Comprehensive experiments on downstream point cloud
tasks and ablation studies demonstrate that the SD model can enhance point
cloud self-supervised learning. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，用于手语生成（SLP），解决了传统方法的误差累积和实时性问题，并通过多尺度姿态表示和置信感知注意力机制提升了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归方法在推理阶段存在误差累积问题，而扩散模型因迭代特性不适用于实时任务。因此，需要一种结合两者优势的方法来提升手语生成的实时性和质量。

Method: 采用混合自回归和扩散模型的方法，设计多尺度姿态表示模块和置信感知因果注意力机制，以优化姿态生成。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和How2Sign数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成质量和实时流效率上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 混合方法有效结合了自回归和扩散模型的优势，显著提升了手语生成的实时性和准确性。

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on
autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently
provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can
prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of
error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that
stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage
step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the
iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire
sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it,
we apply a hybrid approach combining autoregressive and diffusion models to SLP
for the first time, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential
dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body
movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately
extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a
Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal
Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically
guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive
experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time streaming
efficiency.

Conclusion: RoHOI基准和SAMPL策略为HOI检测的鲁棒性研究提供了新标准，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human
assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean
datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions,
leading to inaccurate prediction. To address this, we introduce the first
robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under
diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with
environmental variability, occlusion, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes
20 corruption types based on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new
robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the
related field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To
improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive
Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic
and partial cues, dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance
robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需额外回放数据。

Conclusion: 模态间隙是持续学习中的关键因素，MG-CLIP方法简单有效。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from
continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned
tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting
strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing
interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most
existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its
generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in
the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models.
Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent
to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we
propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's
performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap
preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance
the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective
for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring
additional replay data. Our code is available at

Result: MoMask++在HumanML3D和SnapMoGen基准测试中达到最先进性能，并能处理用户提示。

Conclusion: SnapMoGen和MoMask++为文本生成动作提供了更高质量的数据集和模型，支持长期动作生成和细粒度控制。

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation has experienced remarkable progress in recent
years. However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from
short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This
limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen
prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset
featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive
textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,
accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per
description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips
preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,
facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also
improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,
MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better
exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single
generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the
ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs
to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen. Project

### [289] [PoseLLM: Enhancing Language-Guided Human Pose Estimation with MLP Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09139)
*Dewen Zhang,Tahir Hussain,Wangpeng An,Hayaru Shouno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseLLM提出了一种基于大型语言模型的非线性MLP视觉语言连接器，用于提升姿态估计的精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统姿态估计方法依赖关键点先验，泛化能力有限；现有语言引导方法（如LocLLM）的线性投影器无法捕捉复杂的空间-文本交互。

Method: PoseLLM采用两层的非线性MLP（带GELU激活）作为视觉语言连接器，增强视觉块与文本关键点描述的融合。

Result: 在COCO验证集上达到77.8 AP，优于LocLLM（+0.4 AP），同时在Human-Art和MPII上保持强零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 非线性连接器显著提升定位精度且不牺牲泛化能力，推动了语言引导姿态估计的先进水平。

Abstract: Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode
keypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen
keypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint
localization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization
through textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to
capture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision
localization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language
Model (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector
with a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP
with GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,
enhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.
Trained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO
validation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong
zero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a
simple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization
accuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in
language-guided pose estimation. Code is available at

*Zhimin Liao,Ping Wei,Ruijie Zhang,Shuaijia Chen,Haoxuan Wang,Ziyang Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$I^{2}$-World的高效4D占用预测框架，通过解耦场景标记化并采用编码器-解码器架构，显著提升了3D场景演化的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中复杂3D场景的高效标记化问题，以应对极端情况。

Method: 提出双标记器设计（场景内和场景间），结合多尺度残差量化和残差聚合，采用编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在4D占用预测任务中，mIoU和IoU分别提升25.1%和36.9%，计算效率高（2.9GB内存，37.0FPS）。

Conclusion: $I^{2}$-World在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，为3D场景预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via
occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner
cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized
image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a
critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose
$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method
decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The
intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to
hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The
inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across
timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while
retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only
GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and
predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene
generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,
ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that
$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while
exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of
training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS. Our code is
available on https://github.com/lzzzzzm/II-World.

### [291] [Stable Score Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09168)
*Haiming Zhu,Yangyang Xu,Chenshu Xu,Tingrui Shen,Wenxi Liu,Yong Du,Jun Yu,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSD的稳定分数蒸馏框架，通过简化优化过程并增强对齐性，解决了现有方法在稳定性、空间控制和编辑强度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像和3D编辑方法（如Delta Denoising Score）存在稳定性差、空间控制不足和编辑强度受限的问题，主要源于复杂的辅助结构导致的优化冲突。

Method: SSD通过固定一个分类器到源提示，利用Classifier-Free Guidance方程实现跨提示对齐，并引入空文本分支稳定优化过程。此外，还加入了提示增强分支以提升编辑强度。

Result: SSD在2D和3D编辑任务（如NeRF和文本驱动风格编辑）中取得了最先进的结果，收敛更快且复杂度更低。

Conclusion: SSD提供了一种高效、稳定的文本引导编辑解决方案，能够保持内容结构并实现精准的局部编辑。

Abstract: Text-guided image and 3D editing have advanced with diffusion-based models,
yet methods like Delta Denoising Score often struggle with stability, spatial
control, and editing strength. These limitations stem from reliance on complex
auxiliary structures, which introduce conflicting optimization signals and
restrict precise, localized edits. We introduce Stable Score Distillation
(SSD), a streamlined framework that enhances stability and alignment in the
editing process by anchoring a single classifier to the source prompt.
Specifically, SSD utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) equation to achieves
cross-prompt alignment, and introduces a constant term null-text branch to
stabilize the optimization process. This approach preserves the original
content's structure and ensures that editing trajectories are closely aligned
with the source prompt, enabling smooth, prompt-specific modifications while
maintaining coherence in surrounding regions. Additionally, SSD incorporates a
prompt enhancement branch to boost editing strength, particularly for style
transformations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in 2D and 3D
editing tasks, including NeRF and text-driven style edits, with faster
convergence and reduced complexity, providing a robust and efficient solution
for text-guided editing.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了RGB和深度信息，并通过对比学习和课程学习进一步优化了性能，适用于sim2real迁移任务。

Abstract: Depth information is robust to scene appearance variations and inherently
carries 3D spatial details. In this paper, a visual backbone based on the
vision transformer is proposed to fuse RGB and depth modalities for enhancing
generalization. Different modalities are first processed by separate CNN stems,
and the combined convolutional features are delivered to the scalable vision
transformer to obtain visual representations. Moreover, a contrastive
unsupervised learning scheme is designed with masked and unmasked tokens to
accelerate the sample efficiency during the reinforcement learning progress.
For sim2real transfer, a flexible curriculum learning schedule is developed to
deploy domain randomization over training processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL)中的提示池方法，发现其在增量学习中存在性能下降问题，并提出了一种新的空间提示方法LGSP-Prompt以解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL在现实场景中面临数据稀缺和增量学习的双重挑战，而现有的提示池方法在FSCIL中的表现尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析发现性能下降源于token维度的饱和，因此提出了LGSP-Prompt，将提示学习从token维度转移到空间维度，结合局部空间特征和全局频域表示生成空间提示。

Result: 实验表明，LGSP-Prompt在多个FSCIL基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LGSP-Prompt通过空间提示池有效解决了FSCIL中的性能下降问题，为增量学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) faces dual challenges of data
scarcity and incremental learning in real-world scenarios. While pool-based
prompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental
learning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper
presents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,
revealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.
Through comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from
token-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for
task-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,
we propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively
shifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial
dimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining
local spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight
key patterns in input images. We construct two spatial prompt pools enabling
dynamic prompt selection to maintain acquired knowledge while effectively
learning novel sessions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple FSCIL benchmarks, showing
significant advantages in both base knowledge preservation and incremental
learning. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出MCA-LLaVA方法，通过二维空间衰减缓解大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型中因RoPE长期衰减导致的多模态特征对齐问题。

Method: 基于曼哈顿距离扩展RoPE的长期衰减为二维多方向空间衰减。

Result: MCA-LLaVA在多个幻觉和通用基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: MCA-LLaVA有效缓解了图像对齐偏差，提升了多模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models
(LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key
contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term
decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in
LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction
tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions
within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the
bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are
positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to
insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment.
We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's
perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose
MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a
two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the
one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image
tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image
alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination
and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为THYME的方法，结合层次特征聚合和循环时间细化，解决了动态场景图中空间细节和时间依赖的捕捉问题，并在新数据集AeroEye-v1.0上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景理解在自动驾驶、监控等领域需求迫切，但现有方法在空间细节和时间一致性上表现不足。

Method: THYME方法通过层次特征聚合和循环时间细化，同时建模多尺度空间上下文和时间一致性。

Result: 在ASPIRe和AeroEye-v1.0数据集上，THYME优于现有方法，提升了场景理解的准确性。

Conclusion: THYME方法在动态场景图生成中表现出色，为复杂场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video in applications such as autonomous driving,
surveillance, and sports analytics necessitates robust methods for dynamic
scene understanding. Despite advances in static scene graph generation and
early attempts at video scene graph generation, previous methods often suffer
from fragmented representations, failing to capture fine-grained spatial
details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Temporal Hierarchical Cyclic Scene Graph (THYME)
approach, which synergistically integrates hierarchical feature aggregation
with cyclic temporal refinement to address these limitations. In particular,
THYME effectively models multi-scale spatial context and enforces temporal
consistency across frames, yielding more accurate and coherent scene graphs. In
addition, we present AeroEye-v1.0, a novel aerial video dataset enriched with
five types of interactivity that overcome the constraints of existing datasets
and provide a comprehensive benchmark for dynamic scene graph generation.
Empirically, extensive experiments on ASPIRe and AeroEye-v1.0 demonstrate that
the proposed THYME approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering
improved scene understanding in ground-view and aerial scenarios.

Abstract: Wave propagation on the surface of a material contains information about
physical properties beneath its surface. We propose a method for inferring the
thickness and stiffness of a structure from just a video of waves on its
surface. Our method works by extracting a dispersion relation from the video
and then solving a physics-based optimization problem to find the best-fitting
thickness and stiffness parameters. We validate our method on both simulated
and real data, in both cases showing strong agreement with ground-truth
measurements. Our technique provides a proof-of-concept for at-home health
monitoring of medically-informative tissue properties, and it is further
applicable to fields such as human-computer interaction.

Result: 在三个医学视觉问答基准测试中，Expert-CFG以4.2B参数和有限专家标注优于13B参数的先进模型。

Conclusion: Expert-CFG展示了在资源有限环境中部署临床应用的可行性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have prompted the
development of multi-modal medical assistant systems. Despite this progress,
current models still have inherent probabilistic uncertainties, often producing
erroneous or unverified responses-an issue with serious implications in medical
applications. Existing methods aim to enhance the performance of Medical Vision
Language Model (MedVLM) by adjusting model structure, fine-tuning with
high-quality data, or through preference fine-tuning. However, these
training-dependent strategies are costly and still lack sufficient alignment
with clinical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an
expert-in-the-loop framework named Expert-Controlled Classifier-Free Guidance
(Expert-CFG) to align MedVLM with clinical expertise without additional
training. This framework introduces an uncertainty estimation strategy to
identify unreliable outputs. It then retrieves relevant references to assist
experts in highlighting key terms and applies classifier-free guidance to
refine the token embeddings of MedVLM, ensuring that the adjusted outputs are
correct and align with expert highlights. Evaluations across three medical
visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Expert-CFG,
with 4.2B parameters and limited expert annotations, outperforms
state-of-the-art models with 13B parameters. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of deploying such a system in resource-limited settings for
clinical use.

Conclusion: S3AD算法和KITTI-AR数据集为3D异常检测提供了有效解决方案，增强了模型在开放场景中的适应性。

Abstract: 3D detection technology is widely used in the field of autonomous driving,
with its application scenarios gradually expanding from enclosed highways to
open conventional roads. For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,
3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect
anomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the
generalization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes
and to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D
detection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the
insufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This
paper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,
which decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the
generalization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an
anomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving
target-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the
generalization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize
two augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named
KITTI-AR. KITTI-AR extends upon KITTI by adding 97 new categories, totaling 6k
pairs of stereo images. The KITTI-AR-ExD subset includes 39 common categories
as extra training data to address the sparse sample distribution issue.
Additionally, 58 rare categories form the KITTI-AR-OoD subset, which are not
used in training to simulate zero-shot scenarios in real-world settings, solely
for evaluating 3D anomaly detection. Finally, the performance of the algorithm
and the dataset is verified in the experiments. (Code and dataset can be
obtained at https://github.com/xxxx/xxx).

Conclusion: 球形采样方法有效解决了全景图像处理中的失真问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Due to the current lack of large-scale datasets at the million-scale level,
tasks involving panoramic images predominantly rely on existing two-dimensional
pre-trained image benchmark models as backbone networks. However, these
networks are not equipped to recognize the distortions and discontinuities
inherent in panoramic images, which adversely affects their performance in such
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical sampling method for
panoramic images that enables the direct utilization of existing pre-trained
models developed for two-dimensional images. Our method employs spherical
discrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively
mitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.
Additionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image
segmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for
specific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used
indoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期跟踪方法多为离线，依赖未来帧信息，而实际场景需要在线因果预测，因此研究在线长期点跟踪问题。

Method: 评估视觉基础模型的适用性，提出Track-On模型，将每个跟踪点视为查询，逐帧处理视频。

Result: Track-On在七个公开基准上达到新SOTA，验证了无需未来信息的长期跟踪可行性。

Conclusion: 视觉基础模型可作为初始化，但需专用设计实现在线长期跟踪；Track-On通过Transformer架构和内存机制解决了这一问题。

Abstract: Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames
and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation
supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by
enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term
tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are
available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,
real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate
causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in
streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based
on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes
essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,
offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack
temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines
to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term
point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially
without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating
the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they
can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.
However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design
is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this
causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across
frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that
treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time.
Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks,
demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.

TL;DR: StaRFM是一个统一框架，通过Fisher信息惩罚和置信度对齐惩罚解决基础模型在分布偏移和置信度不匹配问题，提升视觉和医学任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如CLIP和SAM在低样本迁移学习中表现优异，但面临分布偏移和置信度不匹配的挑战，现有解决方案多为领域特定。

Method: 提出StaRFM框架，引入Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度对齐惩罚（CMP），分别处理分布偏移和置信度校准问题。

Result: 在19个视觉数据集和医学分割任务中，StaRFM显著提升性能（如准确率+3.5%，DSC 84.7%），并降低跨域性能差距40%。

Conclusion: StaRFM是一个即插即用的通用框架，无需大幅修改模型结构，适用于多种基础模型。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP and SAM have transformed computer vision and
medical imaging via low-shot transfer learning. However, deployment of these
models hindered by two key challenges: \textit{distribution shift} between
training and test data, and \textit{confidence misalignment} that leads to
overconfident incorrect predictions. These issues manifest differently in
vision-language classification and medical segmentation tasks, yet existing
solutions remain domain-specific. We propose \textit{StaRFM}, a unified
framework addressing both challenges. It introduces a Fisher information
penalty (FIP), extended to 3D medical data via patch-wise regularization, to
reduce covariate shift in CLIP and SAM embeddings. Additionally, a confidence
misalignment penalty (CMP), reformulated for voxel-level predictions,
calibrates uncertainty in segmentation tasks. We theoretically derive PAC-Bayes
bounds showing FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, while CMP
minimizes calibration error through Brier score optimization. StaRFM shows
consistent performance like \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19
vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), 84.7\% DSC and 4.8mm HD95 in
medical segmentation (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and 40\% lower cross-domain
performance gap compared to prior benchmarking methods. The framework is
plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes for seamless integration
with foundation models. Code and models will be released at

Motivation: 理想数字远程呈现需要准确复制人的身体、服装和动作，但自我中心视角存在遮挡和身体比例扭曲的挑战。现有方法多依赖多视角数据训练，而本研究首次利用生成模型从自我中心输入重建虚拟形象。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion和ControlNet，提出一种从遮挡的俯视图生成真实正面视图的流程，并将其输入图像到动作模型生成虚拟形象动作。

Result: 该方法能够从单张俯视图生成逼真的正面视图，并进一步生成虚拟形象动作，为更易用和泛化的远程呈现系统铺平道路。

Conclusion: 通过生成模型和图像到动作模型的结合，本研究实现了从最小输入生成虚拟形象动作，推动了远程呈现技术的发展。

Abstract: An ideal digital telepresence experience requires accurate replication of a
person's body, clothing, and movements. To capture and transfer these movements
into virtual reality, the egocentric (first-person) perspective can be adopted,
which enables the use of a portable and cost-effective device without
front-view cameras. However, this viewpoint introduces challenges such as
occlusions and distorted body proportions.
  There are few works reconstructing human appearance from egocentric views,
and none use a generative prior-based approach. Some methods create avatars
from a single egocentric image during inference, but still rely on multi-view
datasets during training. To our knowledge, this is the first study using a
generative backbone to reconstruct animatable avatars from egocentric inputs.
Based on Stable Diffusion, our method reduces training burden and improves
generalizability.
  Inspired by methods such as SiTH and MagicMan, which perform 360-degree
reconstruction from a frontal image, we introduce a pipeline that generates
realistic frontal views from occluded top-down images using ControlNet and a
Stable Diffusion backbone.
  Our goal is to convert a single top-down egocentric image into a realistic
frontal representation and feed it into an image-to-motion model. This enables
generation of avatar motions from minimal input, paving the way for more
accessible and generalizable telepresence systems.

vision. In recent years, the field has witnessed a proliferation of datasets
and methods designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of paintings. However,
most existing approaches focus solely on static final images, overlooking the
dynamic and multi-stage nature of the artistic painting process. To address
this gap, we propose a novel framework for human-aligned assessment of painting
processes. Specifically, we introduce the Painting Process Assessment Dataset
(PPAD), the first large-scale dataset comprising real and synthetic painting
process images, annotated by domain experts across eight detailed attributes.
Furthermore, we present PPJudge (Painting Process Judge), a Transformer-based
model enhanced with temporally-aware positional encoding and a heterogeneous
mixture-of-experts architecture, enabling effective assessment of the painting
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
baselines in accuracy, robustness, and alignment with human judgment, offering
new insights into computational creativity and art education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGCD-Net通过注意力引导和因果干预解决上下文偏见，提升情感识别的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在情感识别中易受上下文偏见影响（如将特定背景与情绪标签错误关联），需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出AGCD-Net，结合Hybrid ConvNeXt编码器和AG-CIM模块，通过注意力引导和因果干预消除上下文偏见。

Result: 在CAER-S数据集上表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: AGCD-Net证明了因果去偏对复杂场景中情感识别的重要性。

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in
real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context
bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g.
associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces
\textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the
ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and
Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core
of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM),
which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious
correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face
features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust
emotion recognition in complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理高阶关联和语义模糊时表现不足，尤其是软正负样本问题及未充分利用邻域关系。

Method: AAHR结合动态聚类原型对比学习、全局局部特征提取、自适应聚合网络、GNN增强语义交互及动量对比学习。

Result: 在Flickr30K、MSCOCO和ECCV Caption数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升匹配准确性和效率。

Conclusion: AAHR有效解决了语义模糊和高阶关联问题，显著提升了图像-文本匹配性能。

Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer
vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face
challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among
similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft
positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft
negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching
uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the
neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training
batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.
This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning
framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified
representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,
effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework
introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive
aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic
understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and
inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships
among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic
interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum
contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined
strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between
features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets,
considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The
code and model checkpoints for this research are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需依赖注释的分段感知视觉标记化框架，显著降低计算需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无注释手语翻译中模型复杂性和计算需求高的问题，提升可扩展性。

Method: 利用分段感知视觉标记化将连续视频转换为离散标记，结合对比对齐目标和双级监督。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T基准测试中性能超越现有方法，序列长度减少50%，内存使用降低2.67倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术，验证了标记化和对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) has advanced rapidly, achieving
strong performances without relying on gloss annotations. However, these gains
have often come with increased model complexity and high computational demands,
raising concerns about scalability, especially as large-scale sign language
datasets become more common. We propose a segment-aware visual tokenization
framework that leverages sign segmentation to convert continuous video into
discrete, sign-informed visual tokens. This reduces input sequence length by up
to 50% compared to prior methods, resulting in up to 2.67x lower memory usage
and better scalability on larger datasets. To bridge the visual and linguistic
modalities, we introduce a token-to-token contrastive alignment objective,
along with a dual-level supervision that aligns both language embeddings and
intermediate hidden states. This improves fine-grained cross-modal alignment
without relying on gloss-level supervision. Our approach notably exceeds the
performance of state-of-the-art methods on the PHOENIX14T benchmark, while
significantly reducing sequence length. Further experiments also demonstrate
our improved performance over prior work under comparable sequence-lengths,
validating the potential of our tokenization and alignment strategies.

Conclusion: CKD方法有效提升了SNN在DVS数据上的性能，解决了跨模态和跨架构的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in
computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven
characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated
event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance
inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the
performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using
RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this
case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In
this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only
leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the
cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge
distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our
method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and
CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current
State-of-the-Art methods. The code will be available at

TL;DR: Prompt4Trust是一个针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的强化学习框架，旨在通过上下文感知的辅助提示改善模型的置信度校准，提升其在医疗领域的安全性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在医疗等安全关键领域应用时，存在对提示设计敏感和错误回答高置信度的问题，影响其可靠性。

Method: 提出Prompt4Trust框架，通过轻量级LLM生成辅助提示，优化下游任务MLLM的置信度校准和准确性。

Result: 在PMC-VQA基准测试中取得最佳性能，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Prompt4Trust展示了自动化提示工程在提升MLLMs可信度方面的潜力，尤其在安全关键领域。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for
applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical
settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,
and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As
clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of
its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high
confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting
confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce
context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate
responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive
accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically
prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy
clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically
motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task
accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)
performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice
questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework
trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot
generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for
scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work
demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering
for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings. Our

Result: 该方法在挑战性基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且能轻松集成到现有BMD方法中。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效缓解了初始核敏感性问题，提升了盲运动去模糊的性能，并可扩展到非均匀模糊场景。

Abstract: Deep prior-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in blind
motion deblurring (BMD) recently. These methods, however, are often limited by
the high non-convexity of the underlying optimization process in BMD, which
leads to extreme sensitivity to the initial blur kernel. To address this issue,
we propose a novel framework for BMD that leverages a deep generative model to
encode the kernel prior and induce a better initialization for the blur kernel.
Specifically, we pre-train a kernel generator based on a generative adversarial
network (GAN) to aptly characterize the kernel's prior distribution, as well as
a kernel initializer to provide a well-informed and high-quality starting point
for kernel estimation. By combining these two components, we constrain the BMD
solution within a compact latent kernel manifold, thus alleviating the
aforementioned sensitivity for kernel initialization. Notably, the kernel
generator and initializer are designed to be easily integrated with existing
BMD methods in a plug-and-play manner, enhancing their overall performance.
Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle blind non-uniform motion
deblurring without the need for additional priors, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmark datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有楼层平面图定位技术主要关注深度结构线索，忽略了丰富的语义信息。

Method: 采用粗到细的方式构建概率体积，先采样少量光线生成低分辨率概率体积，再在高概率区域密集采样以细化预测。

Result: 在两个标准基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有技术，召回率显著提升，并能轻松整合额外元数据（如房间标签）以提高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合语义信息，显著提升了楼层平面图定位的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure,
revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the
locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization
techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the
rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a
semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic
rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability
volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We
first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution
probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser
sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for
predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two
standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover,
we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as
room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Result: 在三个多光谱点云数据集上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了室外多光谱点云分类的性能。

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from
the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide
range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods
were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor
datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences
in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above
issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion
for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set
generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably
generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning
stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features
of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine
features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage,
an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads
with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes,
improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales
and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a critical role in developing intelligent
assistance systems for minimally invasive procedures such as Endoscopic
Submucosal Dissection (ESD). However, the high visual similarity across
different phases and the lack of structural cues in RGB images pose significant
challenges. Depth information offers valuable geometric cues that can
complement appearance features by providing insights into spatial relationships
and anatomical structures. In this paper, we pioneer the use of depth
information for surgical phase recognition and propose Geo-RepNet, a
geometry-aware convolutional framework that integrates RGB image and depth
information to enhance recognition performance in complex surgical scenes.
Built upon a re-parameterizable RepVGG backbone, Geo-RepNet incorporates the
Depth-Guided Geometric Prior Generation (DGPG) module that extracts geometry
priors from raw depth maps, and the Geometry-Enhanced Multi-scale Attention
(GEMA) to inject spatial guidance through geometry-aware cross-attention and
efficient multi-scale aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we construct a nine-phase ESD dataset with dense frame-level
annotations from real-world ESD videos. Extensive experiments on the proposed
dataset demonstrate that Geo-RepNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining robustness and high computational efficiency under complex and
low-texture surgical environments.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains
underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce
ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical
Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a
handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that
generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive
empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100,
CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess
robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based
prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot
accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space.
Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based
competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine
the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To
foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results
establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot
classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 路径平滑在模仿学习中常被忽视，本文旨在通过引入路径角度自由度（PAF）改进路径相似性。

Method: 提出DAA*方法，结合PAF优化路径缩短和平滑，通过联合优化启发式距离和PAF实现路径最优。

Result: 在7个数据集上验证，DAA*在路径相似性和长度上显著优于神经A*和TransPath。

Conclusion: DAA*在路径最优性和搜索效率间取得平衡，显著提升模仿学习效果。

Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed
deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom
(PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The
PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding
the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high
adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely
aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening
and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively.
Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets,
2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2
scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in
path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path
length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM,
and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path
loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.7% SPR, 6.5% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also
discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where
applicable.

Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在RGB图像合成上表现优异，但透明或分层内容（RGBA图像）的生成因缺乏大规模基准而未被充分探索。

Method: 提出ALPHA基准，扩展RGB指标至四通道图像；开发ALPHAVAE模型，通过复合目标训练，结合RGB和alpha通道表示。

Result: ALPHAVAE在仅8K图像训练下，PSNR提升4.9 dB，SSIM提升3.2%，优于LayerDiffuse，并支持高质量透明图像生成。

Conclusion: ALPHAVAE在透明图像生成上表现优越，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results
in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress
and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation
of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due
to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the
first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to
four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further
introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB
VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a
composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction,
patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence
constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha
representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used
by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase
in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior
transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion
framework. Our code, data, and models are released on

Result: PAUC比传统指标更符合人类偏好，能更准确地评估主动交互场景中的用户体验。

Conclusion: PAUC为主动交互场景提供了更可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态对话系统的发展。

Abstract: With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the
capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an
alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect
multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously
determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video
playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce
ProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's
ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated
at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts
for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate
evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive
benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of
human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human
preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider
the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides
a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction
scenarios. Project homepage:

Abstract: Humans do not understand individual events in isolation; rather, they
generalize concepts within classes and compare them to others. Existing
audio-video pre-training paradigms only focus on the alignment of the overall
audio-video modalities, without considering the reinforcement of distinguishing
easily confused classes through cognitive induction and contrast during
training. This paper proposes the Dynamic Inter-Class Confusion-Aware Encoder
(DICCAE), an encoder that aligns audio-video representations at a fine-grained,
category-level. DICCAE addresses category confusion by dynamically adjusting
the confusion loss based on inter-class confusion degrees, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish between similar activities. To further
extend the application of DICCAE, we also introduce a novel training framework
that incorporates both audio and video modalities, as well as their fusion. To
mitigate the scarcity of audio-video data in the human activity recognition
task, we propose a cluster-guided audio-video self-supervised pre-training
strategy for DICCAE. DICCAE achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the
VGGSound dataset, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.5%. We further evaluate its
feature representation quality through extensive ablation studies, validating
the necessity of each module.

Conclusion: Fast3D通过高效修剪视觉令牌，显著提升了3D多模态大语言模型的实用性。

Abstract: While 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
scene understanding capabilities, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges due to computational inefficiency. The key bottleneck stems from
processing excessive object-centric visual tokens required for comprehensive 3D
scene representation. Although visual token pruning has shown promise in
accelerating 2D MLLMs, its applicability to 3D domains remains largely
unexplored due to fundamental disparities in token structures. In this paper,
we reveal two critical insights: (1) Significant redundancy exists in
object-level 3D token representations, analogous to patch-level redundancy in
2D systems; (2) Global attention patterns exhibit strong predictive power for
identifying non-essential tokens in 3D contexts. Building on these
observations, we propose Fast3D, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework
for 3D MLLMs featuring two technical innovations: (1) Global Attention
Prediction (GAP), where a lightweight neural network learns to predict the
global attention distributions of the target model, enabling efficient token
importance estimation for precise pruning guidance; (2) Sample-Adaptive visual
token Pruning (SAP), which introduces dynamic token budgets through
attention-based complexity assessment, automatically adjusting layer-wise
pruning ratios based on input characteristics. Both of these two techniques
operate without modifying the parameters of the target model. Extensive
evaluations across five benchmarks validate the effectiveness of Fast3D,
particularly under high visual token pruning ratios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用简单的Video ViTs架构和预训练方法在交通异常检测（TAD）中的表现，发现其性能优于复杂架构，并强调了自监督预训练的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TAD方法依赖复杂架构，但预训练基础模型可能简化设计并提升性能。

Method: 采用简单的编码器架构（Video ViTs），研究不同预训练方法（自监督、弱监督、全监督）的效果，并进行领域自适应预训练（DAPT）。

Result: 简单架构在强预训练下性能优于或匹配现有方法，自监督MVM效果最佳，DAPT进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 预训练是关键，简单架构结合有效预训练可实现高效、可扩展的TAD模型。

Abstract: Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on
complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it
remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual
perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training,
allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs.
Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only
approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how
pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) strong
pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the
performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being
significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised
pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less
effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM)
provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on
unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without
requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of
pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be
built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code,
domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work:

Abstract: Crop diseases present a significant barrier to agricultural productivity and
global food security, especially in large-scale farming where early
identification is often delayed or inaccurate. This research introduces a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system designed
to automate the detection and classification of eight common crop diseases
using leaf imagery. The methodology involves a complete deep learning pipeline:
image acquisition from a large, labeled dataset, preprocessing via resizing,
normalization, and augmentation, and model training using TensorFlow with
Keras' Sequential API. The CNN architecture comprises three convolutional
layers with increasing filter sizes and ReLU activations, followed by max
pooling, flattening, and fully connected layers, concluding with a softmax
output for multi-class classification. The system achieves high training
accuracy (~90%) and demonstrates reliable performance on unseen data, although
a validation accuracy of ~60% suggests minor overfitting. Notably, the model
integrates a treatment recommendation module, providing actionable guidance by
mapping each detected disease to suitable pesticide or fungicide interventions.
Furthermore, the solution is deployed on an open-source, mobile-compatible
platform, enabling real-time image-based diagnostics for farmers in remote
areas. This research contributes a scalable and accessible tool to the field of
precision agriculture, reducing reliance on manual inspection and promoting
sustainable disease management practices. By merging deep learning with
practical agronomic support, this work underscores the potential of CNNs to
transform crop health monitoring and enhance food production resilience on a
global scale.

Abstract: Camera traps have long been used by wildlife researchers to monitor and study
animal behavior, population dynamics, habitat use, and species diversity in a
non-invasive and efficient manner. While data collection from the field has
increased with new tools and capabilities, methods to develop, process, and
manage the data, especially the adoption of ML/AI tools, remain challenging.
These challenges include the sheer volume of data generated, the need for
accurate labeling and annotation, variability in environmental conditions
affecting data quality, and the integration of ML/AI tools into existing
workflows that often require domain-specific customization and computational
resources. This paper provides a guide to a low-resource pipeline to process
camera trap data on-premise, incorporating ML/AI capabilities tailored for
small research groups with limited resources and computational expertise. By
focusing on practical solutions, the pipeline offers accessible approaches for
data transmission, inference, and evaluation, enabling researchers to discover
meaningful insights from their ever-increasing camera trap datasets.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial
for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation
(TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data
collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive
a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational
limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these
approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low
processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based
computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and
overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently
impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft
hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of
labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work,
we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and
description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network
architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft
flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain
adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features
with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark
description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns
robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant
landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified
system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: 在CMU-Mocap、MuPoTS-3D和3DPW数据集上取得最优性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该模型通过高效时空设计，实现了高性能和低计算成本的多人体运动预测。

Abstract: 3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to
the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between
agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs
substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally
efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and
temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual
branches that learn local and global representations for individual and
multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level
interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from
both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly
incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient
temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for
multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while
significantly reducing the computational cost. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决参数高效微调（PEFT）方法中因独立训练子模块导致特征子空间不对齐，从而在误导任务ID下产生模糊决策的问题。

Method: 提出双级知识对齐（DKA）和任务置信度引导的适配器混合（TC-MoA）框架，分别用于特征对齐和自适应知识聚合。

Result: 实验表明CKAA优于现有PEFT-based CL方法。

Conclusion: CKAA通过改进特征对齐和推理机制，显著提升了模型在误导任务ID下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) empowers AI models to continuously learn from
sequential task streams. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-based
CL methods have garnered increasing attention due to their superior
performance. They typically allocate a unique sub-module for learning each
task, with a task recognizer to select the appropriate sub-modules for testing
images. However, due to the feature subspace misalignment from independently
trained sub-modules, these methods tend to produce ambiguous decisions under
misleading task-ids. To address this, we propose Cross-subspace Knowledge
Alignment and Aggregation (CKAA), a novel framework that enhances model
robustness against misleading task-ids through two key innovations: (1)
Dual-level Knowledge Alignment (DKA): By aligning intra-class feature
distributions across different subspaces and learning a robust global
classifier through a feature simulation process, DKA enables the model to
distinguish features from both correct and incorrect subspaces during training.
(2) Task-Confidence-guided Mixture of Adapters (TC-MoA): A robust inference
scheme that adaptively aggregates task-specific knowledge from relevant
sub-modules based on task-confidence scores, avoiding overconfidence in
misleading task-id predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAA
outperforms existing PEFT-based CL methods.

Motivation: 视觉和语义概念通常以层次结构存在，但如何高效训练模型以捕捉和利用这种层次结构仍是一个关键问题。

Method: HMID-Net在双曲空间中整合了掩码图像建模（MIM）和知识蒸馏技术，并设计了专门的双曲空间蒸馏损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像分类和检索任务中显著优于MERU和CLIP等现有模型。

Conclusion: HMID-Net证明了在双曲空间中应用MIM和知识蒸馏的高效性，为多模态学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner.
For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study,
MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space
to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy.
However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model
to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the
\textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel
and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge
distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in
hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a
distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective
knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM
and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same
remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our
method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly
outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification
and retrieval.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个新的视频基准测试，旨在评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）是否能真正理解视频内容，而不仅仅是静态图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准测试多类似于图像基准测试，模型仅需扫描关键帧即可回答问题，无法评估LVLMs是否具备深度时间推理能力。

Method: GLIMPSE包含3,269个视频和4,342个视觉中心问题，涵盖11类任务，如轨迹分析和时间推理，所有问题需观看完整视频并推理。

Result: 人类评估准确率达94.82%，但最佳LVLM模型（GPT-o3）仅达66.43%，表明模型在深度视频理解上仍有困难。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE揭示了LVLMs在真正理解视频内容方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing video benchmarks often resemble image-based benchmarks, with
question types like "What actions does the person perform throughout the
video?" or "What color is the woman's dress in the video?" For these, models
can often answer by scanning just a few key frames, without deep temporal
reasoning. This limits our ability to assess whether large vision-language
models (LVLMs) can truly think with videos rather than perform superficial
frame-level analysis. To address this, we introduce GLIMPSE, a benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate whether LVLMs can genuinely think with
videos. Unlike prior benchmarks, GLIMPSE emphasizes comprehensive video
understanding beyond static image cues. It consists of 3,269 videos and over
4,342 highly visual-centric questions across 11 categories, including
Trajectory Analysis, Temporal Reasoning, and Forensics Detection. All questions
are carefully crafted by human annotators and require watching the entire video
and reasoning over full video context-this is what we mean by thinking with
video. These questions cannot be answered by scanning selected frames or
relying on text alone. In human evaluations, GLIMPSE achieves 94.82% accuracy,
but current LVLMs face significant challenges. Even the best-performing model,
GPT-o3, reaches only 66.43%, highlighting that LVLMs still struggle to move
beyond surface-level reasoning to truly think with videos.

Result: 在PaviaU数据集上，相比现有方法，精度显著提升且模型参数减少。

Conclusion: SDTN和TRN的组合为高光谱图像分类提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision
agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease
detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with
high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled
samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges,
we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines
tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust
tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the
complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized
Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a
lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple
scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also
significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly
suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy
and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在零样本任务中表现优异，但在无标注数据的情况下面对分布偏移时性能下降，测试时适应（TTA）方法虽能改善，但缓存方法仍面临熵不可靠和决策边界不灵活的问题。

Method: ReTA结合CER和DDC：CER通过一致性约束加权熵以减少缓存噪声；DDC将类级文本嵌入建模为多元高斯分布，以动态调整决策边界。

Result: 实验表明，ReTA在真实世界分布偏移下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTA通过双重策略提升了缓存方法的可靠性，为VLM在无标注数据下的适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but
struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is
unavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
to improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among
various TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving
historical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering
efficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability
challenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,
causing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation
performance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible
decision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To
address these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)
method that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from
two perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample
selection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware
Entropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight
entropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low
entropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method
leverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and
facilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven
Distribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as
multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for
more accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the latest solution developed by our team,
HFUT-VUT, for the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track of the IJCAI 2025 MiGA
Challenge. The Micro-gesture Online Recognition task is a highly challenging
problem that aims to locate the temporal positions and recognize the categories
of multiple micro-gesture instances in untrimmed videos. Compared to
traditional temporal action detection, this task places greater emphasis on
distinguishing between micro-gesture categories and precisely identifying the
start and end times of each instance. Moreover, micro-gestures are typically
spontaneous human actions, with greater differences than those found in other
human actions. To address these challenges, we propose hand-crafted data
augmentation and spatial-temporal attention to enhance the model's ability to
classify and localize micro-gestures more accurately. Our solution achieved an
F1 score of 38.03, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 37.9%. As a
result, our method ranked first in the Micro-gesture Online Recognition track.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by
leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong
SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in
its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation
pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and
restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves
throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11%
speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains
on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a
domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure,
where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across
multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe,
QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our
method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without
compromising transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DehazeSB提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge的无配对去雾框架，利用最优传输理论直接连接雾图和清晰图的分布，并通过细节保留正则化和提示学习提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GAN的无配对去雾方法因生成器的传输映射能力有限而效果受限，需改进。

Method: 采用Schrödinger Bridge框架，结合最优传输理论和细节保留正则化，并引入提示学习利用CLIP模型区分雾图和清晰图。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: DehazeSB通过优化传输映射和细节保留，显著提升了无配对去雾的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in unpaired dehazing, particularly those using GANs, show
promising performance in processing real-world hazy images. However, these
methods tend to face limitations due to the generator's limited transport
mapping capability, which hinders the full exploitation of their effectiveness
in unpaired training paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose
DehazeSB, a novel unpaired dehazing framework based on the Schr\"odinger
Bridge. By leveraging optimal transport (OT) theory, DehazeSB directly bridges
the distributions between hazy and clear images. This enables optimal transport
mappings from hazy to clear images in fewer steps, thereby generating
high-quality results. To ensure the consistency of structural information and
details in the restored images, we introduce detail-preserving regularization,
which enforces pixel-level alignment between hazy inputs and dehazed outputs.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning to leverage pre-trained CLIP
models in distinguishing hazy images and clear ones, by learning a haze-aware
vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. Code:

*Son Nguyen,Giang Nguyen,Hung Dao,Thao Do,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDInstruct提出了一种新的多模态大语言模型，通过内容感知的分词策略和显式布局建模，显著提升了密集文档的理解能力，同时减少了计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在密集文档上表现不佳，且视觉分词方法随图像大小扩展，导致计算冗余和内存效率低下。

Method: VDInstruct将空间区域检测与语义特征提取分离，采用内容感知分词策略，根据文档复杂度生成分词，并通过三阶段训练范式优化模型。

Result: 在KIE基准测试中达到SOTA，减少图像分词约3.6倍，零样本评估中F1分数超过基线5.5分。

Conclusion: 内容感知分词与显式布局建模为文档理解提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual
documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content
and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on
vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant
computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce
VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic
feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization
strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates
tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure
while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm,
our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching
or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of
image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses
strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its
robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware
tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising
direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model
weights will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态RPCA网络（DRPCA-Net），通过深度展开网络将稀疏性先验整合到可学习架构中，显著提升了红外小目标检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在追求性能时牺牲了可解释性、参数效率和泛化能力，且忽略了红外小目标的固有稀疏性先验。

Method: 结合模型驱动的RPCA范式，提出动态展开机制和轻量级超网络，生成输入场景相关的迭代参数，并设计了动态残差组（DRG）模块以优化背景建模。

Result: 在多个公开红外数据集上，DRPCA-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DRPCA-Net通过动态展开和稀疏性先验的结合，实现了高效且鲁棒的红外小目标检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection plays a vital role in remote sensing,
industrial monitoring, and various civilian applications. Despite recent
progress powered by deep learning, many end-to-end convolutional models tend to
pursue performance by stacking increasingly complex architectures, often at the
expense of interpretability, parameter efficiency, and generalization. These
models typically overlook the intrinsic sparsity prior of infrared small
targets--an essential cue that can be explicitly modeled for both performance
and efficiency gains. To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of
Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network
(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware
prior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods
that rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a
dynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables
the model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the
input scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse
backgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to
better capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more
accurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.
Extensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that
DRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
detection accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/GrokCV/DRPCA-Net.

Result: 在SeqCSIST数据集上，DeRefNet的mAP指标比现有方法提高了5.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次在多帧范式中解决CSIST分离任务，提供了数据集和工具包，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Due to the limitation of the optical lens focal length and the resolution of
the infrared detector, distant Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target (CSIST)
groups typically appear as mixing spots in the infrared image. In this paper,
we propose a novel task, Sequential CSIST Unmixing, namely detecting all
targets in the form of sub-pixel localization from a highly dense CSIST group.
However, achieving such precise detection is an extremely difficult challenge.
In addition, the lack of high-quality public datasets has also restricted the
research progress. To this end, firstly, we contribute an open-source
ecosystem, including SeqCSIST, a sequential benchmark dataset, and a toolkit
that provides objective evaluation metrics for this special task, along with
the implementation of 23 relevant methods. Furthermore, we propose the
Deformable Refinement Network (DeRefNet), a model-driven deep learning
framework that introduces a Temporal Deformable Feature Alignment (TDFA) module
enabling adaptive inter-frame information aggregation. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first endeavor to address the CSIST Unmixing task
within a multi-frame paradigm. Experiments on the SeqCSIST dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with mean Average
Precision (mAP) metric improved by 5.3\%. Our dataset and toolkit are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种分段架构EHPE，通过局部提取指尖和手腕关节，减少误差累积，提升手部姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视指尖和手腕关节的重要性，导致远端关节误差累积，影响整体姿态估计质量。

Method: EHPE分为两个阶段：TW阶段提取指尖和手腕关节，PG阶段通过双分支交互网络优化其余关节位置。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，EHPE达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EHPE通过分段架构有效解决了误差累积问题，显著提升了手部姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation has garnered great attention in recent years due to
its critical applications in human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and
related fields. The accurate estimation of hand joints is essential for
high-quality hand pose estimation. However, existing methods neglect the
importance of Distal Phalanx Tip (TIP) and Wrist in predicting hand joints
overall and often fail to account for the phenomenon of error accumulation for
distal joints in gesture estimation, which can cause certain joints to incur
larger errors, resulting in misalignments and artifacts in the pose estimation
and degrading the overall reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel segmented architecture for enhanced hand pose estimation
(EHPE). We perform local extraction of TIP and wrist, thus alleviating the
effect of error accumulation on TIP prediction and further reduce the
predictive errors for all joints on this basis. EHPE consists of two key
stages: In the TIP and Wrist Joints Extraction stage (TW-stage), the positions
of the TIP and wrist joints are estimated to provide an initial accurate joint
configuration; In the Prior Guided Joints Estimation stage (PG-stage), a
dual-branch interaction network is employed to refine the positions of the
remaining joints. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that EHPE achieves state-of-the-arts performance. Code is available

Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像模型在精确视觉控制、多模态输入平衡和复杂多模态图像生成训练需求方面的局限性。

Method: 结合自回归图像生成器和两阶段训练范式：多模态对齐阶段和指令调优阶段。

Result: 在DreamBench++基准测试中表现优异，优于基线模型，具有更高的图像重建保真度和任务适应性。

Conclusion: MENTOR在模型规模较小、资源有限的情况下，仍能高效实现高质量多模态图像生成。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle
with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring
extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these
limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for
efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image
generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training
paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal
inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or
cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal
alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment,
followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the
integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability.
Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training
resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark,
outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt
following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction
fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to
diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at:

Motivation: 传统艺术字体设计依赖手工，现有生成模型在交互性、局部编辑和多字符组合方面存在局限。

Method: 结合扩散模型，引入无训练的区域注意力机制和噪声混合技术，并利用大语言模型解析用户提示。

Result: 系统支持高质量、多语言的艺术字体生成，提升用户工作流程的灵活性和创意表达。

Conclusion: WordCraft显著增强了艺术字体合成的交互性，为设计师和艺术家提供了更多创意可能。

Abstract: Artistic typography aims to stylize input characters with visual effects that
are both creative and legible. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual
design, while recent generative models, particularly diffusion-based methods,
have enabled automated character stylization. However, existing solutions
remain limited in interactivity, lacking support for localized edits, iterative
refinement, multi-character composition, and open-ended prompt interpretation.
We introduce WordCraft, an interactive artistic typography system that
integrates diffusion models to address these limitations. WordCraft features a
training-free regional attention mechanism for precise, multi-region generation
and a noise blending that supports continuous refinement without compromising
visual quality. To support flexible, intent-driven generation, we incorporate a
large language model to parse and structure both concrete and abstract user
prompts. These components allow our framework to synthesize high-quality,
stylized typography across single- and multi-character inputs across multiple
languages, supporting diverse user-centered workflows. Our system significantly
enhances interactivity in artistic typography synthesis, opening up creative
possibilities for artists and designers.

Conclusion: MA-SAM2在无需额外参数或训练的情况下，显著提升了手术视频分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery,
essential for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable
advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent
limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the
unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent
occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished
performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these
challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video
object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and
occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against
occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while
maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a
multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency
of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any
additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved
performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and
EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical
surgical applications.

Conclusion: ViTCoT为视频推理提供了更直观、认知对齐的方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals
with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as
autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid
development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning
capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual
information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video
reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content
while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning
paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive
and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the
Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for
key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore
the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances
performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively
activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Conclusion: Inter2Former通过动态计算分配策略，成功平衡了交互式分割的速度与精度，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation (IS) improves annotation efficiency by segmenting
target regions from user prompts, with widespread applications in real-world
scenarios. Current approaches face a critical trade-off: dense-token methods
achieve superior accuracy and detail preservation but suffer from prohibitively
slow processing on CPU devices, while the Segment Anything Model (SAM) advances
the field with sparse prompt tokens for fast inference but compromises
segmentation quality. In this paper, we propose Inter2Former to address this
challenge by optimizing computation allocation in dense-token processing, which
introduces four key enhancements. First, we propose Dynamic Prompt Embedding
(DPE) that adaptively processes only regions of interest while avoiding
additional overhead from background tokens. Second, we introduce Dynamic Hybrid
Attention (DHA), which leverages previous segmentation masks to route tokens
through either full attention (O(N2)) for boundary regions or our proposed
efficient BSQ attention (O(N)) for non-boundary regions. Third, we develop
Hybrid Mixture of Experts (HMoE), which applies similar adaptive computation
strategies in FFN modules with CPU-optimized parallel processing. Finally, we
present Dynamic Local Upsampling (DLU), a reverse operation of DPE, which
localizes objects with a lightweight MLP and performs fine-grained upsampling
only in detected regions. Experimental results on high-precision IS benchmarks
demonstrate that Inter2Former achieves SOTA performance with high efficiency on
CPU devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VLMs是否像人类一样整合跨模态信息，特别是bouba-kiki效应。

Method: 使用两种方法评估CLIP的ResNet和ViT变体：基于提示的概率偏好评估和Grad-CAM视觉注意力分析。

Result: 模型未稳定表现bouba-kiki效应，且与人类数据对比表现不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在跨模态概念理解上存在局限性，与人类认知不一致。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether
vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways
that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the
bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like "bouba"
with round shapes and "kiki" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found
in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive
re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer
(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two
complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based
evaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as
a novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our
findings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki
effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance
across both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison
with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall
markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of
human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the
extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting
limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human
intuitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在细粒度分类中无法捕捉动态的类别差异，或计算成本过高。

Result: 在13个细粒度数据集上，性能提升2.78%。

Conclusion: FAIR通过动态跨模态交互和伪标签优化，显著提升了无监督适应的效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by
aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining.
Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained
classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot
capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive
pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that
modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more
accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves
performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained
Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that
dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language
embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the
definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an
adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve
self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a
self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the
presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial
performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable
overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: Anomaly inspection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing, but the
scarcity of anomaly samples significantly limits the effectiveness of existing
methods in tasks such as localization and classification. While several anomaly
synthesis approaches have been introduced for data augmentation, they often
struggle with low realism, inaccurate mask alignment, and poor generalization.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Generate Aligned Anomaly (GAA), a
region-guided, few-shot anomaly image-mask pair generation framework. GAA
leverages the strong priors of a pretrained latent diffusion model to generate
realistic, diverse, and semantically aligned anomalies using only a small
number of samples. The framework first employs Localized Concept Decomposition
to jointly model the semantic features and spatial information of anomalies,
enabling flexible control over the type and location of anomalies. It then
utilizes Adaptive Multi-Round Anomaly Clustering to perform fine-grained
semantic clustering of anomaly concepts, thereby enhancing the consistency of
anomaly representations. Subsequently, a region-guided mask generation strategy
ensures precise alignment between anomalies and their corresponding masks,
while a low-quality sample filtering module is introduced to further improve
the overall quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec AD and LOCO datasets demonstrate that GAA achieves superior performance
in both anomaly synthesis quality and downstream tasks such as localization and
classification.

TL;DR: FaceLLM是一种针对面部图像理解的多模态大语言模型，通过ChatGPT生成高质量问答对训练数据，提升面部相关任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在通用数据集上训练，缺乏对领域特定视觉线索（如面部图像）的推理能力，限制了其在面部结构、表情等任务中的应用。

Method: 提出弱监督流程，利用ChatGPT生成基于FairFace数据集的问答对（FairFaceGPT），训练FaceLLM模型。

Result: FaceLLM在多种面部任务中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceLLM展示了语言模型合成监督在构建领域专用MLLMs中的潜力，为可信赖、以人为本的多模态AI系统树立了先例。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
vision-language tasks. However, existing MLLMs are primarily trained on generic
datasets, limiting their ability to reason on domain-specific visual cues such
as those in facial images. In particular, tasks that require detailed
understanding of facial structure, expression, emotion, and demographic
features remain underexplored by MLLMs due to the lack of large-scale annotated
face image-text datasets. In this work, we introduce FaceLLM, a multimodal
large language model trained specifically for facial image understanding. To
construct the training data, we propose a novel weakly supervised pipeline that
uses ChatGPT with attribute-aware prompts to generate high-quality
question-answer pairs based on images from the FairFace dataset. The resulting
corpus, called FairFaceGPT, covers a diverse set of attributes including
expression, pose, skin texture, and forensic information. Our experiments
demonstrate that FaceLLM improves the performance of MLLMs on various
face-centric tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This work
highlights the potential of synthetic supervision via language models for
building domain-specialized MLLMs, and sets a precedent for trustworthy,
human-centric multimodal AI systems. FairFaceGPT dataset and pretrained FaceLLM
models are publicly available in the project page.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and
accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in
emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key
imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.
This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke
classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from
a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed
method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary
deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional
transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and
ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we
applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The
MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching
an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models
and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish
between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of
transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this,
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework,
particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's
decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and
establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for
early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a
trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its
integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal
stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Abstract: Handwritten character recognition is getting popular among researchers
because of its possible applications in facilitating technological search
engines, social media, recommender systems, etc. The Devanagari script is one
of the oldest language scripts in India that does not have proper digitization
tools. With the advancement of computing and technology, the task of this

methodology that is useful to enhance the recognition rate and configures a
convolutional neural network for effective Devanagari handwritten text
recognition (DHTR). This approach uses the Devanagari handwritten character
dataset (DHCD), an open dataset with 36 classes of Devanagari characters. Each
of these classes has 1700 images for training and testing purposes. This
approach obtains promising results in terms of accuracy by achieving 96.36%
accuracy in testing and 99.55% in training time.

Result: 所有模型在DR预测中表现优异（最高94% AUROC），但公平性评估显示年龄组间存在10% AUROC差距。解缠技术对DINOv2有提升（2% AUROC），但对其他模型有负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了医学影像AI中公平性的重要性，解缠技术的效果因模型而异，需进一步优化以实现公平可靠的医疗解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
adults. While screening reduces the risk of blindness, traditional imaging is
often costly and inaccessible. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms present
a scalable diagnostic solution, but concerns regarding fairness and
generalization persist. This work evaluates the fairness and performance of
image-trained models in DR prediction, as well as the impact of disentanglement
as a bias mitigation technique, using the diverse mBRSET fundus dataset. Three
models, ConvNeXt V2, DINOv2, and Swin V2, were trained on macula images to
predict DR and sensitive attributes (SAs) (e.g., age and gender/sex). Fairness
was assessed between subgroups of SAs, and disentanglement was applied to
reduce bias. All models achieved high DR prediction performance in diagnosing
(up to 94% AUROC) and could reasonably predict age and gender/sex (91% and 77%
AUROC, respectively). Fairness assessment suggests disparities, such as a 10%
AUROC gap between age groups in DINOv2. Disentangling SAs from DR prediction
had varying results, depending on the model selected. Disentanglement improved
DINOv2 performance (2% AUROC gain), but led to performance drops in ConvNeXt V2
and Swin V2 (7% and 3%, respectively). These findings highlight the complexity
of disentangling fine-grained features in fundus imaging and emphasize the
importance of fairness in medical imaging AI to ensure equitable and reliable
healthcare solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像检索系统多限于RGB数据，未能充分利用多传感器（如SAR和多光谱）的物理信息，限制了遥感档案的潜力。

Method: 引入CrisisLandMark数据集（64.7万张图像与结构化文本标注），提出CLOSP框架，通过对比学习对齐光学与SAR图像嵌入空间，并扩展为GeoCLOSP整合地理坐标。

Result: CLOSP在检索任务中nDGC提升54%，GeoCLOSP在位置依赖任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 多传感器数据与地理背景的整合对释放遥感档案潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for
applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However,
most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to
exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the
all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the
spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1
SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual
annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from
authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific
sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),
a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR
images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves
a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.
Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent
difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge
from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which
integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful
trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general
semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving
location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work
highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context
is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.

Motivation: 现有眼部分割方法在运动模糊、眼睑遮挡和领域差异等挑战下表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来提升分割和注视估计的准确性。

Method: 设计了一个基于贝叶斯不确定性学习的框架，显式建模分割不确定性，并通过后验学习量化不确定性水平。

Result: EyeSeg在MIoU、E1、F1和ACC等指标上优于现有方法，尤其在运动模糊、眼睑遮挡和跨域场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: EyeSeg通过不确定性建模显著提升了眼部分割的鲁棒性，为AR/VR中的注视估计提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Human-machine interaction through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR) is increasingly prevalent, requiring accurate and efficient gaze
estimation which hinges on the accuracy of eye segmentation to enable smooth
user experiences. We introduce EyeSeg, a novel eye segmentation framework
designed to overcome key challenges that existing approaches struggle with:
motion blur, eyelid occlusion, and train-test domain gaps. In these situations,
existing models struggle to extract robust features, leading to suboptimal
performance. Noting that these challenges can be generally quantified by
uncertainty, we design EyeSeg as an uncertainty-aware eye segmentation
framework for AR/VR wherein we explicitly model the uncertainties by performing
Bayesian uncertainty learning of a posterior under the closed set prior.
Theoretically, we prove that a statistic of the learned posterior indicates
segmentation uncertainty levels and empirically outperforms existing methods in
downstream tasks, such as gaze estimation. EyeSeg outputs an uncertainty score
and the segmentation result, weighting and fusing multiple gaze estimates for
robustness, which proves to be effective especially under motion blur, eyelid
occlusion and cross-domain challenges. Moreover, empirical results suggest that
EyeSeg achieves segmentation improvements of MIoU, E1, F1, and ACC surpassing
previous approaches. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation has emerged as a promising non-visual
alternative approaches due to its pene-trability and privacy advantages. This
paper presents VST-Pose, a novel deep learning framework for accurate and
continuous pose estimation using WiFi channel state information. The proposed
method introduces ViSTA-Former, a spatiotemporal attention backbone with
dual-stream architecture that adopts a dual-stream architecture to separately
capture temporal dependencies and structural relationships among body joints.
To enhance sensitivity to subtle human motions, a velocity modeling branch is
integrated into the framework, which learns short-term keypoint dis-placement
patterns and improves fine-grained motion representation. We construct a 2D
pose dataset specifically designed for smart home care scenarios and
demonstrate that our method achieves 92.2% accuracy on the PCK@50 metric,
outperforming existing methods by 8.3% in PCK@50 on the self-collected dataset.
Further evaluation on the public MMFi dataset confirms the model's robustness
and effectiveness in 3D pose estimation tasks. The proposed system provides a

Conclusion: 该框架具有广泛适用性，适用于灾害和环境研究，并展示了在大规模区域（如美国和以色列）的可扩展性。

Abstract: High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment
and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the
growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning
approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have
been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).
However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and
monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its
conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of
prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract
estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a
framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for
absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution
Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and
high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program
(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived
DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM
estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x
resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of
magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust
generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with
< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological
analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We
demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.
and Israel. All code and pretrained models are publicly available at:

Abstract: Experiment commentary is crucial in describing the experimental procedures,
delving into underlying scientific principles, and incorporating
content-related safety guidelines. In practice, human teachers rely heavily on
subject-specific expertise and invest significant time preparing such
commentary. To address this challenge, we introduce the task of automatic
commentary generation across multi-discipline scientific experiments. While
recent progress in large multimodal models (LMMs) has demonstrated promising
capabilities in video understanding and reasoning, their ability to generate
fine-grained and insightful experiment commentary remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (i) We
construct \textit{ExpInstruct}, the first dataset tailored for experiment
commentary generation, featuring over 7\textit{K} step-level commentaries
across 21 scientific subjects from 3 core disciplines (\ie, science, healthcare
and engineering). Each sample includes procedural descriptions along with
potential scientific principles (\eg, chemical equations and physical laws) and
safety guidelines. (ii) We propose ExpStar, an automatic experiment commentary
generation model that leverages a retrieval-augmented mechanism to adaptively
access, evaluate, and utilize external knowledge. (iii) Extensive experiments
show that our ExpStar substantially outperforms 14 leading LMMs, which
highlights the superiority of our dataset and model. We believe that ExpStar
holds great potential for advancing AI-assisted scientific experiment
instruction.

Conclusion: EmRACE-3K为具身推理能力的发展提供了有效工具，展示了微调的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,
their effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and
active scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent
perceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action
dynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such
as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment
interactions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and
long-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset
of over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic
environments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.
The tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,
object manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a
multi-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level
instructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express
the agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to
evaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key
dimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage
Goal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below
20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current
limitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of
EmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning
followed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial
improvements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's
effectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.

Result: 令牌压缩方法在通用ViT上有效，但在紧凑设计上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 为未来研究适应紧凑ViT的令牌优化技术提供了方向。

Abstract: Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for
accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the
quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length,
these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers
to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.
First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and
compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,
pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.
plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,
ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain
effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are
increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these
gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token
compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard
and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token
compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often
underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only
provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on
adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks
for edge AI and AI agent applications.

Motivation: 传统变分分数蒸馏（VSD）在实践中存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题，研究发现这是由于LoRA与3D分布不匹配导致的。

Method: 提出线性化前瞻变分分数蒸馏（$L^2$-VSD），通过调整优化顺序和使用线性化模型改进梯度校正。

Conclusion: $L^2$-VSD通过前瞻和线性化优化，显著提升了文本到3D生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation based on score distillation of pre-trained 2D diffusion
models has gained increasing interest, with variational score distillation
(VSD) as a remarkable example. VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can
be improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the
distribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation
gradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to
suffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model
and the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA
and 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their
optimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score
model looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable
corrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable
training in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we
propose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving
rise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).
$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff
functionalities of existing deep learning libraries. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of $L^2$-VSD, revealing its clear superiority over prior
score distillation-based methods. We also show that our method can be
seamlessly incorporated into any other VSD-based text-to-3D framework.

Result: 在RePAIR 2D数据集上实现了最先进的邻域级精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了兼容性计算的性能，适用于考古拼图等实际应用。

Abstract: Pairwise compatibility calculation is at the core of most
fragments-reconstruction algorithms, in particular those designed to solve
different types of the jigsaw puzzle problem. However, most existing approaches
fail, or aren't designed to deal with fragments of realistic geometric
properties one encounters in real-life puzzles. And in all other cases,
compatibility methods rely strongly on the restricted shapes of the fragments.
In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid (geometric and pictorial)
approach for computing the optimal alignment for pairs of fragments, without
any assumptions about their shapes, dimensions, or pictorial content. We
introduce a new image fragments dataset generated via a novel method for image
fragmentation and a formal erosion model that mimics real-world archaeological
erosion, along with evaluation metrics for the compatibility task. We then
embed our proposed compatibility into an archaeological puzzle-solving
framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art neighborhood-level precision and
recall on the RePAIR 2D dataset, directly reflecting compatibility performance

### [361] [NegRefine: Refining Negative Label-Based Zero-Shot OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09795)
*Amirhossein Ansari,Ke Wang,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegRefine提出了一种改进的负标签细化框架，用于零样本OOD检测，通过过滤子类别标签和专有名词，并引入多匹配感知评分函数，提高了检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于负标签的方法（如NegLabel和CSP）在区分OOD样本时存在误判问题，尤其是当负标签为子类别或专有名词时，且难以处理多标签匹配的图像。

Method: NegRefine通过过滤机制排除子类别标签和专有名词，并采用动态调整的多匹配感知评分函数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等大规模基准测试中，NegRefine表现出更鲁棒的OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: NegRefine显著提升了零样本OOD检测的准确性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models like CLIP have enabled
zero-shot OOD detection by leveraging both image and textual label information.
Among these, negative label-based methods such as NegLabel and CSP have shown
promising results by utilizing a lexicon of words to define negative labels for
distinguishing OOD samples. However, these methods suffer from detecting
in-distribution samples as OOD due to negative labels that are subcategories of
in-distribution labels or proper nouns. They also face limitations in handling
images that match multiple in-distribution and negative labels. We propose
NegRefine, a novel negative label refinement framework for zero-shot OOD
detection. By introducing a filtering mechanism to exclude subcategory labels
and proper nouns from the negative label set and incorporating a
multi-matching-aware scoring function that dynamically adjusts the
contributions of multiple labels matching an image, NegRefine ensures a more
robust separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. We evaluate
NegRefine on large-scale benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K. Source code is

### [362] [VRU-Accident: A Vision-Language Benchmark for Video Question Answering and Dense Captioning for Accident Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09815)
*Younggun Kim,Ahmed S. Abdelrahman,Mohamed Abdel-Aty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VRU-Accident是一个大规模视觉语言基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在涉及弱势道路使用者（VRUs）的高风险交通场景中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏标准化的基准来定量评估MLLMs在涉及VRUs的复杂、安全关键场景中的推理能力。

Method: 提出VRU-Accident基准，包含1K真实事故视频、6K多选问答对和1K密集场景描述。

Result: 评估17种MLLMs发现，其在视觉属性上表现良好，但在事故原因、类型和可预防性推理方面存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: VRU-Accident填补了评估MLLMs在VRU安全场景中的空白，揭示了其在复杂推理任务中的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes
involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene
understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no
standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in
complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we
present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident
comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K
multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories
(with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K
dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly
on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture
both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the
current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17
state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense
captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well
on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning
and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.

### [363] [Hierarchical Abstraction Enables Human-Like 3D Object Recognition in Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09830)
*Shuhao Fu,Philip J. Kellman,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了人类和深度学习模型在识别稀疏3D形状（如点云）时的表现差异，发现视觉变换器模型（point transformer）更接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型是否形成与人类相似的3D形状表征，以理解其识别机制。

Method: 通过两个人类实验（点密度与物体方向、局部几何结构）对比卷积神经网络（DGCNN）和视觉变换器模型的表现。

Result: 视觉变换器模型在全局3D形状表征上更接近人类表现，得益于其层次抽象机制。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型在3D物体识别中更符合人类视觉表征，为模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Both humans and deep learning models can recognize objects from 3D shapes
depicted with sparse visual information, such as a set of points randomly
sampled from the surfaces of 3D objects (termed a point cloud). Although deep
learning models achieve human-like performance in recognizing objects from 3D
shapes, it remains unclear whether these models develop 3D shape
representations similar to those used by human vision for object recognition.
We hypothesize that training with 3D shapes enables models to form
representations of local geometric structures in 3D shapes. However, their
representations of global 3D object shapes may be limited. We conducted two
human experiments systematically manipulating point density and object
orientation (Experiment 1), and local geometric structure (Experiment 2).
Humans consistently performed well across all experimental conditions. We
compared two types of deep learning models, one based on a convolutional neural
network (DGCNN) and the other on visual transformers (point transformer), with
human performance. We found that the point transformer model provided a better
account of human performance than the convolution-based model. The advantage
mainly results from the mechanism in the point transformer model that supports
hierarchical abstraction of 3D shapes.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field,
driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex
visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to
extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews
recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1)
methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2)
training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response
tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets
utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning.
Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and
propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and
robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of large-scale models has catalyzed significant
breakthroughs in the digital human domain. These advanced methodologies offer
high-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to
focus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual
human. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M
dataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual
dyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,
SpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It
covers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,
listening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along
two key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized
into four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and
multi-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified
into a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of
2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based
video chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of
metrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.
Both the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly
released. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/SpeakerVid-5M/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D人体表示在虚拟和扩展现实应用中日益重要，但现有方法受限于封闭数据集和长推理时间。

Result: 实验证明该方法在4D人体解析任务中有效且灵活，推理速度提升93.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了4D人体解析的效率和适用性，为开放词汇场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly
critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human
part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets
and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their
applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework
that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time
and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art
open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support
to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based
video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal
correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel
Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and
mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating
memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding
fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of
the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%
acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was
limited to parsing fixed classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实视觉解释方法忽视因果关系和虚假相关性，导致解释质量受限。

Method: 提出CECAS框架，结合因果视角生成反事实解释，避免虚假因素扰动。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现有效性、稀疏性、邻近性和真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: CECAS通过因果引导显著提升反事实解释质量，为模型可解释性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent work on counterfactual visual explanations has contributed to making
artificial intelligence models more explainable by providing visual
perturbation to flip the prediction. However, these approaches neglect the
causal relationships and the spurious correlations behind the image generation
process, which often leads to unintended alterations in the counterfactual
images and renders the explanations with limited quality. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel framework CECAS, which first leverages a
causally-guided adversarial method to generate counterfactual explanations. It
innovatively integrates a causal perspective to avoid unwanted perturbations on
spurious factors in the counterfactuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across multiple
benchmark datasets and ultimately achieves a balanced trade-off among various
aspects of validity, sparsity, proximity, and realism.

*Zhanjiang Yang,Lijun Sun,Jiawei Dong,Xiaoxin An,Yang Liu,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCGA提出了一种两阶段方法，通过先学习光谱模式再估计映射，解决了RGB到HSI重建的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接学习RGB到HSI的映射，忽略了从低维到高维信息的固有挑战。

Method: MCGA采用多尺度VQ-VAE学习光谱模式，并引入灰度感知注意力和量化自注意力优化重建质量。

Result: 实验表明MCGA达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCGA通过两阶段方法和物理驱动的注意力机制，实现了高效且轻量级的HSI重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective
solution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing
learning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the
RGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent
challenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional
information. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,
which first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the
first stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI
datasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the
RGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace
latent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a
direct high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction
quality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,
which adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral
reconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism
ensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an
entropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中物体的任意方向性使得旋转等变性成为关键特性，但现有方法多为近似旋转等变，严格旋转等变的影响尚未明确。

Method: 实现严格旋转等变的骨干和颈部网络，并设计多分支头网络以减少参数并提升检测精度。

Result: 在DOTA-v1.0、DOTA-v1.5和DIOR-R数据集上取得了最优性能，且参数量极低。

Conclusion: 严格旋转等变性对航空图像检测性能有显著提升，多分支头设计在减少参数的同时提高了精度。

Abstract: Due to the arbitrary orientation of objects in aerial images, rotation
equivariance is a critical property for aerial object detectors. However,
recent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.
Most detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn
approximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed
rotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation
equivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve
approximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation
equivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open
question. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone
and neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with
approximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the
impact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.
Additionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant
features, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter
count while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned
improvements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant
single-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an
exceptionally low parameter count.

Motivation: 传统图形设计方法依赖布局生成，缺乏创造力和智能性，且现有基于扩散的方法生成的文件不可编辑，视觉文本渲染效果差。

Result: 实验结果表明，IGD在复杂图形设计任务中具有可扩展性和扩展性，提供了新的解决方案。

Conclusion: IGD为自动化图形设计提供了一种高效、可编辑且智能的新方法。

Abstract: Graphic design visually conveys information and data by creating and
combining text, images and graphics. Two-stage methods that rely primarily on
layout generation lack creativity and intelligence, making graphic design still
labor-intensive. Existing diffusion-based methods generate non-editable graphic
design files at image level with poor legibility in visual text rendering,
which prevents them from achieving satisfactory and practical automated graphic
design. In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to
swiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural
language instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric
rendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and
establish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying
the foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal
understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute
prediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model
to generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD
architecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic
design tasks. The superior experimental results demonstrate that IGD offers a
new solution for graphic design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺导致模型过拟合和数据集不平衡，现有生成方法样本重复且缺乏针对性。

Result: 在MVTec和息肉数据集上分别达到83.63% AP和81.64% mIoU。

Conclusion: Crucial-Diff有效提升模型性能，解决了数据稀缺和样本质量问题。

Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and
autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus
hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies
employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate
data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic
and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's
weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for
different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these
issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to
synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene
Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to
capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates
hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream
model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our
Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving
a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,
Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be
released after acceptance.

Method: 使用DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集，仅以图像为输入，评估模型在18个时尚属性类别中的表现。

Result: Gemini 2.0 Flash的宏F1得分为56.79%，优于GPT-4o-mini的43.28%。

Conclusion: 研究为电商产品属性任务提供了实用见解，并强调了领域特定微调的必要性。

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend
products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the
business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they
navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to
well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly
impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal
data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains
under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art
LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset
DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to
evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study
evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering
insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for
product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows
that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a
macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a
macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide
practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product
attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific
fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research
in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Motivation: 电子显微镜在原子分辨率下对材料的结构-性能关系提供了关键洞察，但辐射损伤限制了其在辐射敏感材料中的应用。

Method: 通过融合多个低分辨率、亚像素位移的图像，并结合CNN增强重建，开发了一种双路径、注意力引导的网络，用于4D-STEM，实现超低剂量下的原子级超分辨率。

Result: 该方法在超低剂量条件下实现了与传统ptychography相当的空间分辨率，适用于非晶、半晶和晶态辐射敏感样品。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了4D-STEM的能力，为辐射敏感材料的结构分析提供了一种通用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While electron microscopy offers crucial atomic-resolution insights into
structure-property relationships, radiation damage severely limits its use on
beam-sensitive materials like proteins and 2D materials. To overcome this
challenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron
microscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that
have been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple
low-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,
multi-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network
for 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose
data. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,
semi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic
evaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial
resolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our
work expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable
method for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在噪声或损坏数据下多视图集成和决策可靠性不足的问题，特别是KL散度忽略模态间领域差距的局限性。

Method: 使用变分Dirichlet分布表示类别概率分布，结合Hölder散度测量分布差异，并集成Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Kalman滤波器优化不确定性估计。

Conclusion: KPHD-Net通过改进的分布差异测量和融合方法，显著提升了多视图学习的性能，并提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Existing multi-view classification and clustering methods typically improve
task accuracy by leveraging and fusing information from different views.
However, ensuring the reliability of multi-view integration and final decisions
is crucial, particularly when dealing with noisy or corrupted data. Current
methods often rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to estimate uncertainty
of network predictions, ignoring domain gaps between different modalities. To
address this issue, KPHD-Net, based on H\"older divergence, is proposed for
multi-view classification and clustering tasks. Generally, our KPHD-Net employs
a variational Dirichlet distribution to represent class probability
distributions, models evidences from different views, and then integrates it
with Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) to improve uncertainty estimation
effects. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Proper H\"older divergence
offers a more effective measure of distribution discrepancies, ensuring
enhanced performance in multi-view learning. Moreover, Dempster-Shafer evidence
theory, recognized for its superior performance in multi-view fusion tasks, is
introduced and combined with the Kalman filter to provide future state
estimations. This integration further enhances the reliability of the final
fusion results. Extensive experiments show that the proposed KPHD-Net
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in both classification and
clustering tasks regarding accuracy, robustness, and reliability, with
theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: In spite of remarkable potential of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in
image generation, the desired properties and optimal design of the autoencoders
have been underexplored. In this work, we analyze the role of autoencoders in
LDMs and identify three key properties: latent smoothness, perceptual
compression quality, and reconstruction quality. We demonstrate that existing
autoencoders fail to simultaneously satisfy all three properties, and propose
Variational Masked AutoEncoders (VMAEs), taking advantage of the hierarchical
features maintained by Masked AutoEncoder. We integrate VMAEs into the LDM
framework, introducing Latent Diffusion Models with Masked AutoEncoders
(LDMAEs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate significantly
enhanced image generation quality and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯对抗攻击（3DGAA）的新框架，通过联合优化几何和外观属性，生成物理上可实现且鲁棒的对抗对象，显著降低目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D和3D物理攻击在平衡物理真实性和攻击鲁棒性方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法来评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性。

Method: 利用3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的14维参数化，联合优化几何（形状、尺度、旋转）和外观（颜色、透明度）属性，并引入物理过滤和增强模块以提高攻击泛化能力。

Result: 在虚拟和物理世界实验中，3DGAA将检测mAP从87.21%降至7.38%，显著优于现有方法，并表现出高迁移性。

Conclusion: 3DGAA是一种实用的攻击框架，可用于评估自动驾驶感知系统的安全性，展示了物理可实现对抗攻击的新水平。

Abstract: Camera-based object detection systems play a vital role in autonomous
driving, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial threats in real-world
environments. While existing 2D and 3D physical attacks typically optimize
texture, they often struggle to balance physical realism and attack robustness.
In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack (3DGAA), a novel
adversarial object generation framework that leverages the full 14-dimensional
parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly optimize geometry
and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior works that rely on
patches or texture, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both geometric attributes (shape,
scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color, opacity) to produce
physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects. We further introduce
a physical filtering module to preserve geometric fidelity, and a physical
augmentation module to simulate complex physical scenarios, thus enhancing
attack generalization under real-world conditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both
virtual benchmarks and physical-world setups using miniature vehicle models.
Experimental results show that 3DGAA achieves to reduce the detection mAP from
87.21% to 7.38%, significantly outperforming existing 3D physical attacks.
Moreover, our method maintains high transferability across different physical
conditions, demonstrating a new state-of-the-art in physically realizable
adversarial attacks. These results validate 3DGAA as a practical attack
framework for evaluating the safety of perception systems in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to support early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
and detection of amyloid accumulation by leveraging the microstructural
information available in multi-shell diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, using a vision
transformer-based deep learning framework.
  Methods: We present a classification pipeline that employs the Swin
Transformer, a hierarchical vision transformer model, on multi-shell dMRI data
for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and amyloid presence. Key metrics
from DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable
transfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models. To efficiently adapt the
transformer to limited labeled neuroimaging data, we integrated Low-Rank
Adaptation. We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction
(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)
and amyloid status classification.
  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the
scope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of
95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with
Alzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it
reached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild
cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from
amyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying
amyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects. Grad-CAM-based
explainability analysis identified clinically relevant brain regions, including
the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, as key contributors to model
predictions.
  Conclusion: This study demonstrates the promise of diffusion MRI and
transformer-based architectures for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and
amyloid pathology, supporting biomarker-driven diagnostics in data-limited
biomedical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of UAV technology and its extensive application in
various fields such as military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and
logistics, achieving efficient and accurate Anti-UAV tracking has become
essential. The importance of Anti-UAV tracking is increasingly prominent,
especially in scenarios such as public safety, border patrol, search and
rescue, and agricultural monitoring, where operations in complex environments
can provide enhanced security. Current mainstream Anti-UAV tracking
technologies are primarily centered around computer vision techniques,
particularly those that integrate multi-sensor data fusion with advanced
detection and tracking algorithms. This paper first reviews the characteristics
and current challenges of Anti-UAV detection and tracking technologies. Next,
it investigates and compiles several publicly available datasets, providing
accessible links to support researchers in efficiently addressing related
challenges. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the major vision-based and
vision-fusion-based Anti-UAV detection and tracking algorithms proposed in
recent years. Finally, based on the above research, this paper outlines future
research directions, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing the
field.

*Geyou Zhang,Kai Liu,Ce Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为I-BSC的新方法，通过加权求和条纹图像而非相位帧，显著降低动态测量中的运动误差，同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PSP在动态测量中因物体运动导致误差，需解决运动误差和计算效率问题。

Method: I-BSC方法通过加权求和条纹图像，仅需一次反正切计算，降低计算复杂度。

Result: I-BSC在减少运动误差和计算效率上优于现有方法，实现准单帧速率3D重建。

Conclusion: I-BSC在动态测量中表现出色，兼具高精度和高效率。

Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is widely used in high-precision 3D
scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise handling.
However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static
does not hold in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object motion.
To address this challenge, our proposed solution, phase-sequential binomial
self-compensation (P-BSC), sums successive motion-affected phase frames
weighted by binomial coefficients. This approach exponentially reduces the
motion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its
efficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation
due to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.
Inspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation
(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase
frames, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image
sequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both
limitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show
that 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error
while achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate
equals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high
pixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the
computational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the
computational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster
motion error convergence.

TL;DR: Hyma提出了一种基于超网络的多模态模型对齐方法，显著降低了最优单模态模型选择和连接器训练的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在连接多模态模型时计算成本高，且单模态模型选择复杂。

Method: 利用超网络的参数预测能力，联合训练连接器模块，覆盖多种单模态模型组合。

Result: Hyma将搜索成本降低10倍，同时保持与网格搜索相当的性能。

Conclusion: Hyma为多模态模型对齐提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple
existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an
autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a
connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or
representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the
complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets
coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal
models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module
training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied
critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel
all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector
training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the
parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained
connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our
experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by
$10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and
trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of
diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著降低内存消耗的同时保持高性能，支持高质量的设备端个性化。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了内存高效且高质量的模型个性化，适用于资源有限的设备。

Abstract: Memory-efficient personalization is critical for adapting text-to-image
diffusion models while preserving user privacy and operating within the limited
computational resources of edge devices. To this end, we propose a selective
optimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on
low-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution
images (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As
observed in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to
target-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to
resolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with
minimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior
adaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for
effective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural
consistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To
maximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware
probabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization
strategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting
from BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while
ensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,
high-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.

Motivation: 点云地点识别（PCPR）在动态环境中需要持续学习能力，但现有模型存在灾难性遗忘问题，导致性能下降和实用性受限。

Method: 提出LifelongPR框架，包括动态样本选择方法和基于提示学习的CL框架，结合两阶段训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在mIR@1和mR@1上分别提升6.50%和7.96%，遗忘率降低8.95%。

Conclusion: LifelongPR有效解决了PCPR中的持续学习问题，提升了模型性能和实用性。

Abstract: Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry
and robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent
transportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of
a positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and
accumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the
ability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance
degradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or
sensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance
costs, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of
PCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual
learning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge
from sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we
propose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample
sizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially
diverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain
shifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight
prompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific
feature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on
large-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in
mR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F. The code and pre-trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/zouxianghong/LifelongPR.

understanding, as it is a necessary first stage for many downstream tasks like
character analysis, story indexing, or metadata enrichment. We formalize PSS
for this unique medium and curate a new 20,800-page annotated dataset. CoSMo,
developed in vision-only and multimodal variants, consistently outperforms
traditional baselines and significantly larger general-purpose vision-language
models across F1-Macro, Panoptic Quality, and stream-level metrics. Our
findings highlight the dominance of visual features for comic PSS
macro-structure, yet demonstrate multimodal benefits in resolving challenging

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it
remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,
salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine
learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal
images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and
explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including
color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge
detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction
using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature
set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural
network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy
while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.
Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed
model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This
work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource
agricultural settings.

Conclusion: MoVieS通过统一建模动态场景，支持零样本应用，并在效率和效果上取得突破。

Abstract: We present MoVieS, a novel feed-forward model that synthesizes 4D dynamic
novel views from monocular videos in one second. MoVieS represents dynamic 3D
scenes using pixel-aligned grids of Gaussian primitives, explicitly supervising
their time-varying motion. This allows, for the first time, the unified
modeling of appearance, geometry and motion, and enables view synthesis,
reconstruction and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework.
By bridging novel view synthesis with dynamic geometry reconstruction, MoVieS
enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on
task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range
of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object
segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency
of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while
offering several orders of magnitude speedups.

Conclusion: 通过频率域调节机制，论文有效解决了扩散模型中的曝光偏差问题，提升了生成质量，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are
significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key
observation: the energy of the predicted noisy images decreases during the
diffusion process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The
reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and
high-frequency subbands; 2) This energy reduction results in amplitude
variations between the network-reconstructed clean data and the real clean
data. Based on the first finding, we introduce a frequency-domain regulation
mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and
high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we provide a more
accurate analysis of exposure bias in the two subbands. Our method is
training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality
of various diffusion models and providing a robust solution to exposure bias
across different model architectures. The source code is available at

Result: 在西藏札达土林地区的实验中，IoU从直接迁移的25.50%提升至64.84%。

Conclusion: 该策略有效解决了领域差异导致的性能下降，为数据稀缺且环境独特的遥感场景提供了高精度信息提取的技术范例。

Abstract: To address the prevalent challenges of domain shift and small sample sizes in
remote sensing image water body segmentation, this study proposes and validates
a two-stage transfer learning strategy based on the SegFormer model. The
approach begins by training a foundational segmentation model on a diverse
source domain, where it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 68.80% on
its validation set, followed by fine-tuning on data from the distinct target
domain. Focusing on the Zhada Tulin area in Tibet -- a region characterized by
highly complex topography and spectral features -- the experimental results
demonstrate that this strategy significantly boosts the IoU for the water body
segmentation task from 25.50% (for direct transfer) to 64.84%. This not only
effectively resolves the model performance degradation caused by domain
discrepancy but also provides an effective technical paradigm for
high-precision thematic information extraction in data-scarce and
environmentally unique remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a
zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder,
CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs (>77 tokens). To
remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP which includes three novel modules: (1)
A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked
and raw images respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while
preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with
unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction.
(3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers
to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M
images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for
training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For
downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers
promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with
long-text input.

existing global identities through a prioritized global matching strategy. New
global IDs are only introduced when no sufficiently similar trajectory or

Abstract: Pixel-level annotation is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised
segmentation methods address this challenge by learning models on few labeled
images alongside a large corpus of unlabeled images. Although foundation models
could further account for label scarcity, effective mechanisms for their
exploitation remain underexplored. We address this by devising a novel
semi-supervised panoptic approach fueled by two dedicated foundation models. We
enhance recognition by complementing unsupervised mask-transformer consistency
with zero-shot classification of CLIP features. We enhance localization by
class-agnostic decoder warm-up with respect to SAM pseudo-labels. The resulting
decoupled enhancement of recognition and localization (DEARLi) particularly
excels in the most challenging semi-supervised scenarios with large taxonomies
and limited labeled data. Moreover, DEARLi outperforms the state of the art in
semi-supervised semantic segmentation by a large margin while requiring 8x less
GPU memory, in spite of being trained only for the panoptic objective. We
observe 29.9 PQ and 38.9 mIoU on ADE20K with only 158 labeled images. The

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在超声心动图中使用先进点跟踪方法进行精确运动估计的潜力，通过改进训练策略和提出轻量级网络，显著提升了性能。


<details>

Conclusion: 尽管某些点跟踪模型表现有限，但改进方法在临床评估中显示出更好的可重复性，与专家验证工具更接近。

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in
echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While
traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate
cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored
in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.
Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general
videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain
limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode
ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different
views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we
refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations
to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through
impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging
multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced
spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their
baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker
boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error
by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking
models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking
accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to
echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods
improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated,
semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in
real-world applications.

Result: 反馈模型在噪声条件下表现显著优于前馈模型，且仅需两个训练样本即可实现高于随机性能。

Conclusion: 反馈机制增强了模型的鲁棒性和数据效率，为更自适应和生物启发的神经网络架构提供了方向。

Abstract: While biological vision systems rely heavily on feedback connections to
iteratively refine perception, most artificial neural networks remain purely
feedforward, processing input in a single static pass. In this work, we propose
a predictive coding inspired feedback mechanism that introduces a recurrent
loop from output to input, allowing the model to refine its internal state over
time. We implement this mechanism within a standard U-Net architecture and
introduce two biologically motivated operations, softmax projection and
exponential decay, to ensure stability of the feedback loop. Through controlled
experiments on a synthetic segmentation task, we show that the feedback model
significantly outperforms its feedforward counterpart in noisy conditions and
generalizes more effectively with limited supervision. Notably, feedback
achieves above random performance with just two training examples, while the
feedforward model requires at least four. Our findings demonstrate that
feedback enhances robustness and data efficiency, and offer a path toward more
adaptive and biologically inspired neural architectures. Code is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 由于隐私问题和手动标注的高成本，合成数据成为预训练模型的流行选择，但合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距（如光照、颜色和视角差异）限制了预训练-微调范式的效果。

Method: 提出了一种统一的文本人物检索流程，包含两个主要组件：图像级域适应的Domain-aware Diffusion（DaD）和区域级适应的Multi-granularity Relation Alignment（MRA）。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES、ICFG-PEDES和RSTPReid数据集上取得了最先进的成果。

Conclusion: 通过双级别域适应方法，有效缩小了合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距，提升了文本人物检索的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify
individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues
and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become
a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements.
However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and
real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color,
and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of
the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified
text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both
image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,
i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and
Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the
name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images
from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,
e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level
alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their
descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.
Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved
state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,
outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are

TL;DR: ECP框架通过两阶段方法提升MLLM在高分辨率图像上的性能，无需训练且任务无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，因固定分辨率训练导致泛化能力差，而降采样又损失细节。

Method: 提出ECP框架，先利用降采样图像的预测定位候选区域，再基于候选区域生成最终输出。

Result: 在4K GUI grounding和4K、8K MLLM感知任务上分别提升21.3%、5.8%、5.2%。

Conclusion: ECP有效保留细节并提升性能，适用于高分辨率图像任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.
However, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and
reasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that
MLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained
image encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images
directly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution
discrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring
consistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then
Predict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework
designed to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key
intuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,
their predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization
cues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and
then predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively
preserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by
high-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K
MLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared
to baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种非对称表示学习（ARL）策略，通过不平衡优化解决多模态学习中的性能问题，证明了模态依赖与方差反比关系的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常因优化不足而表现不如单模态学习，现有方法通过梯度平衡解决，但作者认为不平衡学习才是最优设置。

Method: 提出ARL策略，通过辅助正则化器计算模态预测方差，并基于方差重新加权优化，同时引入预测偏差以最小化泛化误差。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了ARL的有效性和通用性，且无需额外参数。

Conclusion: ARL通过不平衡优化显著提升多模态学习性能，且独立于模型结构和融合方法。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may
perform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue
to imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through
gradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not
the optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we
prove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of
their variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the
Asymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning
via imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each
modality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates
coefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each
modality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to
the modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,
ARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly
optimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share
parameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality
representation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters
and is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal
model. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the
effectiveness and versatility of ARL. Code is available at

Conclusion: 情绪表达受种族背景影响，情绪普遍性假设存在过度概括，种族感知框架为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: How much does ethnicity play its part in emotional expression? Emotional
expression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human
psychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial
hidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and
interviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression
analysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion
universality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and
social contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of
ethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the
emotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective
of manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate
the level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.
We construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically
annotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically
annotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and
stereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain
influence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we
propose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature
learning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises
ethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved
understanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary
investigation into this new realm of research. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在性能不如单模态的问题，现有方法未能解释主导模态在多模态模型中表现不佳的原因。

Method: 提出DGL框架，通过截断多模态损失的反向传播梯度，并用单模态损失梯度替代，消除梯度干扰。

Result: 实验表明DGL在多模态任务中有效且通用。

Conclusion: DGL成功解决了多模态学习中的优化冲突，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have
worse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this
problem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them
through gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant
modality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In
this work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the
cross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to
each modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the
performance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the
unimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)
framework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality
fusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient
back-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces
it with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient
back-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This
helps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and
modality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.
Finally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and
frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of the proposed DGL. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA的新方法，通过训练LoRA层实现高效个性化人体图像生成，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化人体图像生成需要精确保留属性（如身份、服装细节），现有方法需推理时微调或大规模数据集训练，计算成本高且不实用。

Method: 训练LoRA层，利用衣柜条件和空间参考减少信息丢失，引入选择性主题区域损失以优化生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保真度和一致性上显著优于现有技术，实现真实且保留身份的全身体合成。

Conclusion: Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA无需推理时额外参数，仅需少量训练样本，为个性化图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve personalization by learning specific
subjects, allowing learned attributes to be integrated into generated images.
However, personalized human image generation remains challenging due to the
need for precise and consistent attribute preservation (e.g., identity,
clothing details). Existing subject-driven image generation methods often
require either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new
subject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches
are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel
part-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By
training only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at
inference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key
idea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage
spatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and
consistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which
encourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our
loss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while
maintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no
additional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a
single model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and
benchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing
techniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and
identity-preserving full-body synthesis.

Motivation: Reflow在训练中通过确定性耦合改善图像生成质量，但存在分布差距问题，导致生成速度慢且质量受限。

Method: 提出VRFNO框架，结合编码器和神经速度场，引入历史速度项和噪声优化技术，优化耦合并减少误差。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，VRFNO显著优于Reflow，在单步和少步生成任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VRFNO通过创新设计有效解决了Reflow的局限性，提升了生成图像的速度和质量。

Abstract: The Reflow operation aims to straighten the inference trajectories of the
rectified flow during training by constructing deterministic couplings between
noises and images, thereby improving the quality of generated images in
single-step or few-step generation. However, we identify critical limitations
in Reflow, particularly its inability to rapidly generate high-quality images
due to a distribution gap between images in its constructed deterministic
couplings and real images. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel
alternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization
(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a
neural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical
velocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more
accurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise
optimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real
images which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors
caused by Reflow's limitations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic data and
real datasets with varying resolutions show that VRFNO significantly mitigates
the limitations of Reflow, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both
one-step and few-step generation tasks.

Motivation: 传统密集预测方法在性能和效率上存在局限，SL旨在通过维度提升实现更高效、准确的预测。

Method: SL将2D输入（如图像）提升至高维空间（如3D），并使用高维网络（如3D U-Net）处理，生成结构化输出。

Result: 在19个基准数据集上验证，SL在减少98%参数和降低推理成本的同时，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: SL为密集预测任务提供了一种高效、准确的新范式。

Abstract: We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction
tasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a
higher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks
designed for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,
this dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark
tasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and
significantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework
produces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This
emergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables
robust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.
We validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic
segmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense
prediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in
the U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new
vision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,
accurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.

Conclusion: ProGait数据集填补了假肢步态分析的空白，提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Prosthetic legs play a pivotal role in clinical rehabilitation, allowing
individuals with lower-limb amputations the ability to regain mobility and
improve their quality of life. Gait analysis is fundamental for optimizing
prosthesis design and alignment, directly impacting the mobility and life
quality of individuals with lower-limb amputations. Vision-based machine
learning (ML) methods offer a scalable and non-invasive solution to gait
analysis, but face challenges in correctly detecting and analyzing prosthesis,
due to their unique appearances and new movement patterns. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by introducing a multi-purpose dataset, namely ProGait,
to support multiple vision tasks including Video Object Segmentation, 2D Human
Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis (GA). ProGait provides 412 video clips from
four above-knee amputees when testing multiple newly-fitted prosthetic legs
through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait
patterns of human subjects with transfemoral prosthetic legs. Alongside the
dataset itself, we also present benchmark tasks and fine-tuned baseline models
to illustrate the practical application and performance of the ProGait dataset.
We compared our baseline models against pre-trained vision models,
demonstrating improved generalizability when applying the ProGait dataset for
prosthesis-specific tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，AUROC提升2.80%，FPR95降低11.13%。

Conclusion: SynOOD通过合成边界OOD数据显著提升了模型性能，且参数和运行时增加极少。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in
detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD
samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,
can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like
diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a
potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel
approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging
OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level
discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative
in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,
boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise
adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,
effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully
synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label
features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between
near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,
with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly
surpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by
11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative technologies presents both unprecedented
creative opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in maintaining
social trust and ensuring the integrity of digital information. Following these
concerns, the challenge of AI-Generated Image Detection (AID) becomes
increasingly critical. As these technologies become more sophisticated, the

weakness in current AI-Generated Image Detection models: while they perform
exceptionally well on controlled benchmark datasets, they struggle
significantly with real-world variations. To assess this, we introduce ITW-SM,
a new dataset of real and AI-generated images collected from major social media
platforms. In this paper, we identify four key factors that influence AID
performance in real-world scenarios: backbone architecture, training data
composition, pre-processing strategies and data augmentation combinations. By
systematically analyzing these components, we shed light on their impact on
detection efficacy. Our modifications result in an average AUC improvement of
26.87% across various AID models under real-world conditions.

Motivation: 探索风格迁移是否能在语义分割中减少纹理偏差并提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格迁移在语义分割中具有普适性，能有效减少纹理依赖并增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization
capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular
DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image
classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an
effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can
likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we
perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those
random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting
style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with
the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing
their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that
in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and
strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well
as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural
networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on
PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.

Motivation: 在稀疏输入的对象中心场景中，背景纹理对相机位姿估计的准确性有显著影响，因此需要研究如何利用背景纹理进行攻击。

Method: 提出Kaleidoscopic Background Attack（KBA），利用多对称性圆盘和投影方向一致性损失优化背景纹理。

Result: 实验表明，优化的对抗性背景能有效攻击多种相机位姿估计模型。

Conclusion: KBA方法通过多对称性背景和一致性优化，显著提升了攻击效果，为相机位姿估计的安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Camera pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision task that is
essential for applications like visual localization and multi-view stereo
reconstruction. In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the
accuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background
textures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.
In light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which
uses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These
discs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective
attacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.
Additionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize
the kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack
effectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial
kaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation
models.

Motivation: 传统Transformer架构将图像嵌入为均匀的网格令牌，忽略了语义信息，导致特征表示不优。

Method: 提出Fuzzy Token Clustering Transformer（FTCFormer），结合聚类下采样模块、DPC-FKNN机制、SCS评分和Cmerge策略。

Result: 在32个数据集上验证，FTCFormer在图像分类任务中表现优于基线，提升1.43%（细粒度数据集）、1.09%（自然图像）、0.97%（医学图像）、0.55%（遥感图像）。

Conclusion: FTCFormer通过语义驱动的令牌分配，显著提升了特征表示和分类性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success
across various computer vision tasks, largely attributed to their long-range
self-attention mechanism and scalability. However, most transformer
architectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting
the underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal
feature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token
Clustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based
downsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic
meanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less
informative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,
regardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance
feature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak
Clustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center
determination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a
channel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments
on 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer
on image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer
baseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,
1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%
on four remote sensing datasets. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统方法在严重退化情况下难以保留细粒度的身份特征，导致结果缺乏个体特性。IP-FVR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: IP-FVR利用参考图像作为视觉提示，采用解耦交叉注意力机制和反馈学习方法，结合余弦相似度和时间聚合，减少帧间和帧内身份漂移。

Result: IP-FVR在合成和真实数据集上表现优于现有方法，修复质量和身份一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: IP-FVR在保持身份一致性和修复质量方面具有显著优势，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Face Video Restoration (FVR) aims to recover high-quality face videos from
degraded versions. Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,
identity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing
average-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these
challenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality
reference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during
the denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity
information from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention
mechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip
identity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback
learning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with
suffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift
within sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an
exponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by
iteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.
This method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.
Additionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative
prompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and
minimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR
outperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,
showcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video
restoration.

Motivation: 线性投影器在视频MLLM中导致语义模糊和时间不连贯，而现有方法未能有效解决这些问题。

Method: DisCo包含视觉概念判别器（VCD）和时间焦点校准器（TFC），分别用于增强语义区分和时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo在多个视频理解基准上显著优于现有方法，并提高了令牌效率。

Conclusion: DisCo为视频MLLM提供了一种高效且性能优越的视觉封装解决方案。

Abstract: In video Multimodal Large Language Models (video MLLMs), the visual
encapsulation process plays a pivotal role in converting video contents into
representative tokens for LLM input. While linear projectors are widely
employed for encapsulation, they introduce semantic indistinctness and temporal
incoherence when applied to videos. Conversely, the structure of resamplers
shows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains
unexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,
a novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and
temporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key
components: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique
semantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative
concepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring
consistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video
frame. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we
demonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
across a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher
token efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness. The code:

Result: 在Phoenix-2014T基准测试中，性能优于单流变体，达到无注释方法的最高BLEU-4分数。

Conclusion: 双编码器框架有效提升了无注释手语翻译的性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language videos into
spoken or written text. While early systems relied on gloss annotations as an
intermediate supervision, such annotations are costly to obtain and often fail
to capture the full complexity of continuous signing. In this work, we propose
a two-phase, dual visual encoder framework for gloss-free SLT, leveraging
contrastive visual-language pretraining. During pretraining, our approach
employs two complementary visual backbones whose outputs are jointly aligned
with each other and with sentence-level text embeddings via a contrastive
objective. During the downstream SLT task, we fuse the visual features and
input them into an encoder-decoder model. On the Phoenix-2014T benchmark, our
dual encoder architecture consistently outperforms its single stream variants
and achieves the highest BLEU-4 score among existing gloss-free SLT approaches.

Conclusion: IMD有效解决了基础模型在特征匹配中的对齐问题，显著提升了多实例匹配性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the vision foundation models has emerged as a mainstream paradigm
that improves the performance of image feature matching. However, previous
works have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into
feature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the
foundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image
understanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings
derived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the
optimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective
mechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image
understanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle
when addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we
introduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching
with a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant
solutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize
global semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to
effectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism
in generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image
interaction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information
interaction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,
we propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance
scenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly
evaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our
method efficiently mitigates the misalignment.

Conclusion: QLIP为扩散模型的高效量化提供了新思路，尤其适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as
text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits
their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network
quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient
diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not
consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of
information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text
Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit
precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be
seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance
quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the
quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Abstract: We introduce FGSSNet, a novel multi-headed feature-guided semantic
segmentation (FGSS) architecture designed to improve the generalization ability
of wall segmentation on floorplans. FGSSNet features a U-Net segmentation
backbone with a multi-headed dedicated feature extractor used to extract
domain-specific feature maps which are injected into the latent space of U-Net
to guide the segmentation process. This dedicated feature extractor is trained
as an encoder-decoder with selected wall patches, representative of the walls
present in the input floorplan, to produce a compressed latent representation
of wall patches while jointly trained to predict the wall width. In doing so,
we expect that the feature extractor encodes texture and width features of wall
patches that are useful to guide the wall segmentation process. Our experiments
show increased performance by the use of such injected features in comparison
to the vanilla U-Net, highlighting the validity of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: VRGAdapter提供了一种更通用的适配器解决方案，并通过不确定性引导的多分支融合提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Textual adapter-based tuning methods have shown significant potential in
transferring knowledge from pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
downstream tasks. Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual
feature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to
inherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists
significant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such
description diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can
benefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic
adapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,
it is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To
address these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter
and develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first
models the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class
relationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex
Random Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message
propagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each
class node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve
textual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter
solution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In
addition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also
introduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that
dynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有零样本目标检测（ZSD）方法主要针对粗粒度对象，而现实场景中常需处理细粒度对象（如不同鸟类、鱼类和花卉），其类别间差异微小，难以区分。

Method: 提出MSHC方法，基于改进的两阶段检测器，采用多级语义感知嵌入对齐损失，确保视觉与语义空间的紧密耦合。

Result: 在构建的FGZSD-Birds数据集上，MSHC方法优于现有ZSD模型。

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了细粒度零样本目标检测问题，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) aims to leverage semantic descriptions to
localize and recognize objects of both seen and unseen classes. Existing ZSD
works are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are
visually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in
real life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where
the classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting
different kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.
  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained
Zero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of
different classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We
develop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on
an improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware
embedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and
semantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for
the new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,
which contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera
and 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method
outperforms existing ZSD models.

Abstract: Real-world visual perception requires invariance to diverse transformations,

optimizing candidate transformations toward visually typical, "canonical"

Our experiments demonstrate improved robustness of CLIP and SAM across
challenging transformations, including 2D/3D rotations, illumination shifts
(contrast and color), and day-night variations. We also highlight potential
applications in active vision. Our approach challenges the assumption that
transform-specific training is necessary, instead offering a scalable path to
invariance. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sutkarsh/focal.

Method: 设计了一个TDA特征工程流程，并将其与ResNet18结合，用于遥感分类。

Result: 在EuroSAT数据集上达到99.33%的准确率，超越所有单模型表现；在RESISC45数据集上比基线高1.82%。

Conclusion: TDA特征能与深度学习结合，提升性能，扩展了TDA的适用性。

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field that is gaining
rapid adoption due to its robustness and ability to effectively describe
complex datasets by quantifying geometric information. In imaging contexts, TDA
typically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract
discriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local
features. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering
pipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep
learning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the
performance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving
99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model
accuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x
larger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our
method's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45
dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in
satellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA
features can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without
explicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A
clean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Conclusion: SC-AGIQA通过结合文本-视觉语义约束，显著提升了AI生成图像的质量评估效果。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI)
technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly
vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like
CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when
applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic
misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we
propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment
(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints
to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image
consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach
integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned
challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic
Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and
comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and
the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which
draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing
frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to
better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of
fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-Animal提出了一种无需稀疏关键点标注的视频动画3D动物重建框架，通过密集特征网络和分层对齐策略提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀疏语义关键点，标注成本高且不可靠，需改进。

Method: 引入密集特征网络映射2D表示到SMAL参数，结合分层对齐策略整合多级线索。

Result: 实验表明4D-Animal优于基线方法，生成高质量3D资产。

Conclusion: 该方法高效稳定，适用于大规模应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing methods for reconstructing animatable 3D animals from videos
typically rely on sparse semantic keypoints to fit parametric models. However,
obtaining such keypoints is labor-intensive, and keypoint detectors trained on
limited animal data are often unreliable. To address this, we propose
4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from
videos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a
dense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,
enhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.
Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates
silhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D
visual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions
across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms
both model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets
generated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential
for large-scale applications. The code is released at

*Hongyong Han,Wei Wang,Gaowei Zhang,Mingjie Li,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoralVQA是首个针对珊瑚礁分析的大规模VQA数据集，包含12,805张真实珊瑚图像和277,653个问答对，为珊瑚礁生态和健康状况提供全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 珊瑚礁监测需要专业知识，现有VQA技术缺乏针对珊瑚图像的专用数据集。

Method: 开发半自动数据构建流程，结合海洋生物学家确保数据质量和可扩展性。

Result: 评估多个先进LVLM模型，揭示其局限性和改进机会。

Conclusion: CoralVQA为珊瑚保护提供新基准，推动LVLM在珊瑚礁监测中的应用。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet vulnerable ecosystems that require continuous
monitoring to support conservation. While coral reef images provide essential
information in coral monitoring, interpreting such images remains challenging
due to the need for domain expertise. Visual Question Answering (VQA), powered
by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), has great potential in user-friendly
interaction with coral reef images. However, applying VQA to coral imagery
demands a dedicated dataset that addresses two key challenges: domain-specific
annotations and multidimensional questions. In this work, we introduce
CoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It
contains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3
oceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess
ecological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop
a semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine
biologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.
CoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for
studying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By
evaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and
opportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,
with a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.

### [422] [RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10461)
*Tao Tang,Chengxu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPNet是一种新的全色锐化架构，通过内容自适应卷积和动态特征融合模块提升空间细节提取和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在全色锐化中因卷积核的均匀应用而忽略局部内容变化，限制了性能。

Method: RAPNet采用Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv)生成空间自适应核，并结合Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF)模块优化空间细节与光谱保真度。

Result: 在公开数据集上，RAPNet在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，消融实验验证了自适应组件的有效性。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过自适应机制显著提升了全色锐化的性能，为遥感图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution
panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to
generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the
effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently
constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all
spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this
issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive
convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive
Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive
kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of
spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the
Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an
attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail
enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly
available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared
to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the
effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.

*Zhicun Yin,Junjie Chen,Ming Liu,Zhixin Wang,Fan Li,Renjing Pei,Xiaoming Li,Rynson W. H. Lau,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RefSTAR的盲人脸图像恢复方法，通过参考图像的选择、转移和重建，解决了身份保留问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在身份保留上存在不足，主要由于对细节纹理的特征引入不当。

Method: 构建了参考选择模块（RefSel），设计了特征融合范式，并提出了参考图像重建机制。

Result: 实验表明，RefSTAR在身份保留和参考特征转移质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: RefSTAR通过有效引入参考图像特征，显著提升了盲人脸图像恢复的效果。

Abstract: Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex
degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods
introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality
reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,
mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this
paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from
high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image
restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and
reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference
selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a
RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating
masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the
trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion
paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.
Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further
ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle
consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive
experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,
showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer
quality. Source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are available at

*David G. Shatwell,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GT-Loc是一种基于检索的新方法，联合预测图像的捕获时间（小时和月份）和地理位置（GPS坐标），通过共享高维特征空间对齐嵌入，优于现有时间预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间戳预测与地理定位之间的相互依赖问题，支持元数据校正、检索和数字取证等应用。

Method: 采用图像、时间和位置的独立编码器，在共享高维特征空间中对齐嵌入，提出基于循环环形表面的时间度量学习目标。

Result: GT-Loc在时间预测上优于现有方法，即使后者使用真实地理位置输入，同时在地理定位任务中表现竞争性。

Conclusion: GT-Loc通过联合优化时间预测和地理定位，提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案，适用于多种图像检索任务。

Abstract: Timestamp prediction aims to determine when an image was captured using only
visual information, supporting applications such as metadata correction,
retrieval, and digital forensics. In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely
on cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes
and weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly
depend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to
geo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel
retrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)
and geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate
encoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a
shared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,
instead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,
we propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by
modeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present
new benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous
time prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an
input during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results
on standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates
compositional and text-based image retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合半监督联邦学习、室内定位导航和视觉识别的跌倒检测框架，整体准确率达99.99%，兼顾隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老龄化加剧导致跌倒风险增加，需要高效可靠的检测系统以减少医疗支出和恢复时间，同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 采用三种互补系统：半监督联邦学习跌倒检测（SF2D）、室内定位导航系统和视觉识别系统，结合可穿戴设备和边缘设备。

Result: SF2D准确率99.19%，视觉识别准确率96.3%，导航系统成功率95%，综合准确率达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效可靠，隐私保护性强，适合老年人跌倒检测。

Abstract: The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in
older adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can
greatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely
intervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective
and reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this
work, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary
systems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system
(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human
fall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall
scenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor
localization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a
robot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an
edge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen
people. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different
accuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to
99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%
accuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the
accuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework
creates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall
accuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,
but it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度的自蒸馏方法，用于优化息肉分割任务中的深度学习模型，减少资源消耗并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在息肉检测和分割中表现优异，但参数过多易导致过拟合和泛化能力差。知识蒸馏和自蒸馏虽有效，但资源消耗大。

Method: 采用动态置信系数计算批次内前后迭代的损失，仅需存储前次迭代数据，无需额外计算或内存。

Result: 在息肉分割任务中表现优于现有最优模型，并在多临床中心数据集上泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and
precise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these
state-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large
number of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,
particularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor
generalization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and
self-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the
limitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are
resource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory
during training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that
outperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data
storage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage
during testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and
current iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from
multiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the
paper is accepted.

*Chenyu Lian,Hong-Yu Zhou,Zhanli Hu,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个全面的视网膜异常检测基准，解决了现有方法在数据、算法和评估上的局限性，并提出了新方法NFM-DRA，实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜异常检测对疾病筛查至关重要，但缺乏公开的综合性基准，限制了方法的发展和公平评估。

Method: 引入系统性基准，结合解耦异常表示（DRA）和正常特征记忆（NFM），提出NFM-DRA方法。

Result: NFM-DRA在性能上优于现有方法，但对某些未见异常仍存在性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为视网膜异常检测提供了更全面的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and
systemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been
hindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,
which is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.
Due to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal
images has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of
anomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of
generalization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.
Furthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly
focus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),
overlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that
are commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce
a benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and
systematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and
benchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach
leveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the
best performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when
encountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms
in one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with
a Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a
new SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at
https://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.

TL;DR: 论文比较了多种方法在多视图Transformer中利用相机几何信息，提出了一种新的相对位置编码PRoPE，并在多个任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图计算机视觉任务中，相机几何关系对3D感知至关重要，但如何有效利用这些关系仍是一个挑战。

Method: 比较了三种方法：token级光线图编码、attention级相对位姿编码，以及新提出的PRoPE（捕捉完整的相机参数）。

Result: 实验表明，PRoPE在多个任务（如新视图合成、立体深度估计）中均能提升性能，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PRoPE是一种有效的相机几何编码方法，适用于多种多视图任务，且具有扩展性。

Abstract: Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用高分辨率地球观测数据和深度学习技术，首次绘制了莫桑比克全国2100万个农田的分布图，准确率达93%，揭示了小农户农业系统的复杂性和农田规模的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于科学的政策以提升小农户农业的可持续性，但缺乏对农田空间分布和规模等基础系统属性的理解。

Method: 整合高分辨率（1.5米）地球观测数据和深度迁移学习，以最小参考数据需求实现全国范围的农田划分。

Result: 绘制了莫桑比克2023年2100万个农田的分布图，准确率达93%，农田规模中位数为0.16公顷，83%小于0.5公顷。

Conclusion: 农田规模是影响农业社会经济和环境结果（如粮食生产、生计、森林砍伐）的关键指标。

Abstract: The design of science-based policies to improve the sustainability of
smallholder agriculture is challenged by a limited understanding of fundamental
system properties, such as the spatial distribution of active cropland and
field size. We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation
data and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex
agricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference
data requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first
national-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering
~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural
land use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission
errors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union
(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field
delineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture
fragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global
land cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural
frontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in
Mozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16
ha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial
resolution (0.05{\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of
accessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation
reflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder
farms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.
Our results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to
socio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food
production, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their
trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQ框架通过预训练的VAE快速训练VQ-VAE，显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高压缩率VQ-VAE训练计算成本高，需要数千GPU小时，ReVQ旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练VAE，通过控制量化噪声和引入通道多组量化及后矫正器，快速训练VQ-VAE。

Result: ReVQ在单张NVIDIA 4090上22小时完成训练，压缩ImageNet图像至512个token，rFID为1.06。

Conclusion: ReVQ在效率和重建质量间取得优越平衡，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: Visual tokenizers are pivotal in multimodal large models, acting as bridges
between continuous inputs and discrete tokens. Nevertheless, training
high-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often
necessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained
VAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization
noise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present
\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs
to enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By
integrating \textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook
capacity and a \textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ
compresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive
reconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training
costs by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:
ReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,
whereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs. Experimental
results show that ReVQ achieves superior efficiency-reconstruction trade-offs.

self-supervised approach to learning robust chimpanzee face embeddings from
unlabeled camera-trap footage. Leveraging the DINOv2 framework, we train Vision
Transformers on automatically mined face crops, eliminating the need for
identity labels. Our method demonstrates strong open-set re-identification
performance, surpassing supervised baselines on challenging benchmarks such as
Bossou, despite utilising no labelled data during training. This work
underscores the potential of self-supervised learning in biodiversity
monitoring and paves the way for scalable, non-invasive population studies.
