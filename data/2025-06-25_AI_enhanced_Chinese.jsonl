The system\nenhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live\ntraffic video streams.

Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine\ngrained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle\nattributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline\nwhere each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and\npassed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,\ncomposed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained\nspecifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under\nvaried conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.\nAdditionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time\nAPI that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to\nensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage\napproach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon\nemissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset\nenriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates.

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

Clinicians visually\nevaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score\nbased on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits.

To\nsupport dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated\nrouter at each iteration step within a layer.

CoE demonstrates improved performance under\nfixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to\n1.12 compared to a standard MoE.

Recent studies have typically focused on fusing\ncross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.\nHowever, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high\nmemory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost\nalways higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and\ngeneralization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to\nbecome a standard graph data preprocessing method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u9897\u7c92\u7403\uff08GBGC\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7c97\u5316\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7c97\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c97\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "GBGC\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9897\u7c92\u7403\u56fe\u7ec6\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u9897\u7c92\u7403\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9897\u7c92\u7403\u4e3a\u8d85\u8282\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u7c97\u5316\u56fe\u3002", "result": "GBGC\u7684\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u6570\u5341\u81f3\u6570\u767e\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u51e0\u4e4e\u59cb\u7ec8\u9ad8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "GBGC\u56e0\u5176\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, in the natural sciences, a\ndesirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical\nrelationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a\nbaseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further\noptimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both\ninputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for\nfoundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new\nvariables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for\nmaking foundation models more accessible to communities with limited\ncomputational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86Aurora\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u7684\u6c34\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c35%\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u662f\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65b0\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This approach enables the system to\nsimultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual\nsemantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In\nextensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both\nautomatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG\nsignificantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based\nGraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria.

To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a\nrobust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and\ncontext-aware augmentation.

Each method provides evidence for the existence of\nthought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that\ndisproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought\nanchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an\nopen-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our\nmethods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods\nthat map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,\nresulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We\nintroduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust\nfunction calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.\nAs an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional\ndecision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically\nselecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios.

In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via\nReinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic\nDifficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the\nproblem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time\nparty members attributes.

Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex\ntasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet\nthis strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token\ngeneration occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency.

Automating ancient\nscript image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale\ninterpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.\nWith the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with\nnumerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary\nwidely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic\nsystems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and\nmethodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,\nincluding imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven\nthe development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by\ncategorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective\nrecognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.\nWe then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining\ntheir impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and\nnoise-robust techniques.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings.

However, existing\nmedical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple\nvisual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess\nexpert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for\nevaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports\nthrough a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four\nvision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical\nerror types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:\nclassification, detection, and correction.

It proposes a detection method based on federated\ncontrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional\ncentralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and\nanomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed\ncollaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature\ndiscrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to\nrepresent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system\nlogs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both\ncontrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect\nfine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical\nattack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario\nto examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It\ndemonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing\ncomplex anomalies in distributed environments.

However, processing\nlong video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and\ncomputational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both\nstrong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task.

Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM\noutputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a\nuser or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never\nperfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as\ncorrectness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified\nreward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance\n-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we\ncharacterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when\nand how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this\nphenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we\nintroduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact\napproximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We\nshow that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where\nthe true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of\na broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter\nthis effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence\nin high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals.

This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates.

However, uncertainty due to model misspecification\ncontinues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM\nframework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under\neconomic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality.

The high penetration of\nrenewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the\noperating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the\nadoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy.

Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each\nnode are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to\npredict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed\nPGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,\nwhere some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation\nunits.

While the use of LLMs\nis explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts\nfor LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle\nchanges in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy\ngeneration) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this\nchallenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given\ninput-output examples.\n  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt\noptimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We\nevaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM\nbeing used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of\ncanonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and\ndiversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,\nand (f) the dataset being used for training and testing.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC\nalgorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,\nexpert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows\ndevelopers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,\npotentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u75c5\u4f8b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u75c7\u72b6\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff08SC\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u4f8b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u578b\u672c\u4f53\uff08HPO\uff09\u7684\u75be\u75c5-\u8868\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u6a21\u62dfSC\u8bbf\u8c08\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7R\u5e73\u65b9\u7cfb\u6570\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eHPO\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\uff08R\u00b2=0.831\u548c0.78\uff09\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9884\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

However, joint evolution across heterogeneous\nagents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training\ninstability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity.

Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms.

However, existing approaches face\ncritical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and\nsuffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified\nfor computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce\nFastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for\nlarge-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small\nordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered\ngraph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and\naggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual\ndistinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual\nand real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables\nFastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale\nsparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,\na distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between\nsubgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically\nreducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our\nmodels across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein\ndynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark\n(113,000 nodes).

As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is\nestimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This\napproach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to\nimproved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are\ninherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question\narises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting\nat the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk\nminimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term\novertuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical\nrelevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML\nliterature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously\nassumed, typically mild but occasionally severe.

Their design involves a\nhigh-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive\nphysics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma\nphysics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more\naccessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by\nthe lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and\ndatasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic\n(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial\nfusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we\nrelease an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,\npaired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance\nmetrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and\noptimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three\noptimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective\ngeometric optimization problem, (2) a \"simple-to-build\" QI stellarator, and (3)\na multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs\nbetween compactness and coil simplicity.

However, variations\nin system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to\ndrastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for\nconstructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training.

OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices.

Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for\nSurgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage\nfine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities\nby utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).\nFurthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our\nRFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional\nillusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate\nthat Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in\nthe Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its\nreasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach.

This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism.

The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

We propose a novel technique to (1)\ndetect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically\nrealizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,\nwhere we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)\nwith a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%\naccuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d7\u611f\u67d3\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684Top-5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523074%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u768456%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce\nMambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image\nclassification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS\nbuilds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and\nintroduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the\nfrequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our\narchitecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively\nevaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,\nNWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks.

This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation\nthat merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation\nnodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph.

The learned incentive\nfunctions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling\nweighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation\nenvironment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train\nthe proposed restoration planning methods.

Although highly effective in practice, the\nunderlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt\nalignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by\nanalyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high\nfrequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,\nlow-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while\nhigh-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a\nuniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to\noversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality\nat low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance\n(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency\ncomponents and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG\nimproves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high\nCFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets\nand models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while\npreserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,\nestablishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard\nclassifier-free guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08FDG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08CFG\uff09\u5728\u9891\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u522b\u8c03\u8282\u9ad8\u4f4e\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CFG\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793aCFG\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a7\u5236\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFDG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06CFG\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u9891\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u8c03\u8282\u5176\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "FDG\u5728\u4f4e\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9ad8CFG\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u9971\u548c\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFDG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6CFG\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FDG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aCFG\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model.

Their inherent spatial, temporal, and\nspectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video\ncompression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for\ncompressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.\nOur approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high\nfidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,\nDeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the\nmachine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at\nsignificantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without\ncompromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is\nobserved when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their\nrespective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance\nprediction and landcover segmentation).

Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image\nsegmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally\ntrained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed\nSAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated\nthe need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism\nof SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via\na Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel\nPseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to\nautomatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction\nby guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated\nto clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning.

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in\nclose-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal\nprojection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose.

Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion\ntypically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are\nless pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two\nresponsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving\nbackground, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt\nand an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion\nsequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the\nsynthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a\nnovel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the\nmoving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a\nparametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent\nblending.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers\nvideo-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated\nmeshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,\nmulti-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on\ntemplate renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional\nencodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment\nbetween video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to\nmotion generation task.
