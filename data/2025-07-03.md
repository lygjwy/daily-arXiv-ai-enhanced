### [1] [Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)
*Iñaki Dellibarda Varela,Pablo Romero-Sorozabal,Eduardo Rocon,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文澄清了关于大型推理模型（LRMs）是否具备真正推理能力的争议，通过改进实验方法，发现LRMs在复杂任务中表现有限，但在可解问题中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI社区对LRMs是否具备真正推理能力的争议，澄清实验设计和结论的误解。

Method: 复制并改进原始研究中的两个争议性基准（汉诺塔和过河问题），引入逐步提示和协作对话方法。

Result: LRMs在汉诺塔任务中因认知限制表现不佳，但在可解的过河问题中表现优异。

Conclusion: LRMs是离散状态空间中的随机搜索器，未来需要在符号推理和长期规划方面进一步研究。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

### [2] [Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282)
*Matthew JY Kang,Wenli Yang,Monica R Roberts,Byeong Ho Kang,Charles B Malpas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗诊断中的局限性，尤其是在痴呆症诊断和护理中，提出混合方法（结合统计学习和专家知识）以提高透明度和临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际临床环境中未能显著提升诊断效果，因此需要探索其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过范围综述分析AI在临床环境中的局限性，提出结合统计学习和专家知识的混合方法，如PEIRS和ATHENA-CDS。

Result: 研究发现，纯数据驱动的AI缺乏透明度和因果推理能力，而混合方法能更好地融入临床工作流程并提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 未来AI决策支持应注重解释性和临床实用性，结合神经符号AI和人类因果知识，并衡量其对临床工作流程和患者结果的影响。

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

Result: 在20多所机构中部署，评分超过30万份作业，评分时间减少65%，高置信度预测与教师评分一致率达95.4%。

Conclusion: Pensieve有效提升评分效率，同时保持评分质量，适用于多学科STEM课程。

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large
university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an
AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned
scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus
narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve
supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final
feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and
has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and
empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces
grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate
with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

### [7] [Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)
*Yanfei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架Agent-as-tool，将工具调用过程与推理过程分离，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在工具调用和推理过程中面临挑战，模型需同时处理冗余信息和无关符号，增加了推理负担。

Method: 采用分层框架Agent-as-tool，将工具调用和推理过程分离，让模型专注于推理。

Result: 在少量样本（180个）上微调后，性能显著提升，Bamboogle任务中表现优异，超过Search-R1。

Conclusion: Agent-as-tool框架有效减轻了模型负担，提升了推理性能，为LLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

### [8] [T3DM: Test-Time Training-Guided Distribution Shift Modelling for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01597)
*Yuehang Si,Zefan Zeng,Jincai Huang,Qing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的TKG推理方法T3DM，通过建模分布偏移和设计高质量负采样策略，提升了推理的全局一致性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模事件分布偏移和生成高质量负样本方面存在不足，影响了推理性能。

Method: 提出T3DM方法，结合测试时训练指导的分布偏移建模和基于对抗训练的负采样策略。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: T3DM通过优化分布偏移建模和负采样，显著提升了TKG推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Abstract: Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product
ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge.
This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work,
we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

### [10] [Joint Matching and Pricing for Crowd-shipping with In-store Customers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01749)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用店内顾客作为配送员的集中式众包配送系统，针对城市最后一公里配送效率的需求。提出了一种结合MDP、NeurADP和DDQN的动态优化策略，显著降低了配送成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对城市最后一公里配送效率的需求，探索利用店内顾客作为配送员的众包模式，以降低成本并提高效率。

Method: 采用MDP模型处理订单和配送员的随机到达及接受不确定性，结合NeurADP和DDQN进行动态订单分配和定价优化。

Result: 实验显示，NeurADP + DDQN策略比固定定价节省6.7%成本，比短视基线节省约18%。灵活配送和多目的地路由进一步降低成本8%和17%。

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

### [11] [Refining Gelfond Rationality Principle Towards More Comprehensive Foundational Principles for Answer Set Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01833)
*Yi-Dong Shen,Thomas Eiter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了回答集编程（ASP）中回答集语义的通用原则，提出了对Gelfond回答集（GAS）原则的细化，并定义了新的语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究回答集语义是否需要强制满足最小模型属性、约束单调性和基础性，以及探索其他可能的通用原则。

Method: 通过例子说明现有条件的局限性，细化GAS原则，扩展支持性概念，定义新语义，并评估现有语义。

Result: 提出了细化后的GAS原则，定义了新的回答集语义，并分析了计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 细化后的GAS原则为回答集语义提供了更灵活的框架，同时保持了逻辑上的合理性。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large
university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an
AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned
scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus
narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve
supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final
feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and
has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and
empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces
grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate
with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究同时处理工具调用和推理过程，依赖未处理的工具结果，增加了模型推理负担。

Method: 采用分层框架，分离工具调用和推理过程，由不同代理处理。

Result: 仅需少量强化学习微调（180样本），在Bamboogle上表现优异（63.2%精确匹配，75.2%覆盖精确匹配）。

Conclusion: Agent-as-tool框架有效提升模型推理能力，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

Result: 实验表明，T3DM在大多数情况下优于现有基线方法，提供了更优且更鲁棒的结果。

Conclusion: T3DM通过改进分布偏移建模和负采样策略，显著提升了TKG推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨现有答案集语义的条件是否过于严格，以及如何改进这些条件以更合理地定义答案集。

Method: 方法包括分析现有条件的问题，提出改进的Gelfond答案集原则，并定义新的答案集语义。

Result: 结果表明，改进的原则能避免排除预期答案集，并提供了更合理的语义定义。

Conclusion: 结论是改进的Gelfond答案集原则为答案集语义提供了更灵活和合理的基础。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

TL;DR: FSIGenZ提出了一种少样本启发的生成零样本学习框架，通过动态调整属性评分和原型估计，减少对大规模特征合成的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成零样本学习方法需要大量计算资源和合成数据，违背了零样本学习的初衷。FSIGenZ旨在通过动态属性评分和原型估计解决这一问题。

Method: 引入模型特定属性评分（MSAS）动态调整属性评分，估计组级原型作为未见类别的合成特征，并使用双重目的语义正则化（DPSR）训练语义感知对比分类器（SCC）。

Result: 在SUN、AwA2和CUB基准测试中，FSIGenZ使用更少的合成特征实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FSIGenZ通过动态属性评分和原型估计，有效减少了计算资源需求，同时保持了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）面临计算和内存挑战，量化是解决方案，但量化误差和激活异常值限制了其效果。

Method: DBellQuant采用可学习的双钟形转换算法（LTDB），将单钟形权重分布转换为双钟形以减少二值化误差，并通过逆转换平滑激活。

Result: 在Wikitext2数据集上，DBellQuant在LLaMA2-13B上实现了14.39的困惑度，显著优于BiLLM的21.35。

Conclusion: DBellQuant在激进量化的同时保持高性能，为LLMs的实际应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 停止梯度和指数移动平均是避免表示崩溃的有效方法，且具有理论支持。

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet
Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical
representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant
allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar
FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion
simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning
algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data
sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2.
Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries
were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine
learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of
each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the
selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced
through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden
layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal
model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons
respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and

frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to

providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的多视图动态决策框架，用于多组学数据分类，旨在降低测试成本的同时保持高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学技术成本高昂，过度依赖完整组学数据可能导致资源浪费，因此需要一种既能减少冗余测试又能保持诊断准确性的方法。

Method: 在单组学层面，通过改进神经网络激活函数生成Dirichlet分布参数，利用主观逻辑量化分类结果的置信度和不确定性；在多组学层面，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合异构模态，动态决策机制逐步引入数据直至满足条件。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（ROSMAP、LGG、BRCA、KIPAN）上评估，超过50%的案例通过单组学模态实现准确分类，减少了冗余测试，同时保持了与完整组学模型相当的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低测试成本的同时，保持了高诊断准确性和生物学洞察力，为多组学数据分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Motivation: 在线服务对高效实时推荐系统的需求日益增长，需要解决混合GNN-LLM推荐系统的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient
recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with
processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore,
considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning
next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge
personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FSTA的分解技术，通过保留稳定解段并聚合节点来加速迭代求解器，同时引入L2Seg神经网络框架智能识别稳定与不稳定部分，实验显示其可将求解器速度提升7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代搜索启发式在解决车辆路径问题（VRP）中表现优异，但存在大量冗余计算，尤其是在大规模VRP中。论文旨在通过减少冗余计算来加速求解器。

Method: 提出FSTA分解技术，保留稳定解段并聚合节点；引入L2Seg神经网络框架，通过三种变体（非自回归、自回归及其协同）智能识别稳定与不稳定部分。

Result: 在CVRP和VRPTW上的实验表明，L2Seg可将求解器速度提升高达7倍，且NAR与AR协同效果最佳。

Conclusion: L2Seg是一个灵活框架，兼容传统、学习和混合求解器，适用于广泛的VRP问题，显著提升了求解效率。

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于PPO的强化学习方法，用于训练神经模糊控制器，相比之前的DQN方法，表现出更低的方差和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的基于DQN的神经模糊控制器训练方法，通过引入PPO算法提升稳定性和收敛速度。

Method: 使用PPO算法替换原有的DQN框架，构建稳定的on-policy actor-critic循环，并在CartPole-v1环境中进行验证。

Result: PPO训练的模糊控制器在CartPole-v1中实现了500 +/- 0的平均回报，方差更小且收敛更快。

Conclusion: PPO为训练可解释的神经模糊控制器提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy
controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work
that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in
reinforcement learning tasks.

Result: 算法能在毫秒级找到最优分割，动态边缘网络中训练延迟降低24.62%-38.95%。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于复杂AI模型分割。

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 动态架构调整方法显著提升了模型性能，尤其在时间序列分类中效果突出。

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖同质数据集和静态模型，限制了其在多样化临床环境中的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用Transformer架构和生成式掩码预训练策略，从大规模异构健康记录中学习统一表示。

Result: CSFM在多种心脏感知任务中表现优于传统单模态单任务方法，并适应不同传感器配置。

Conclusion: CSFM是一种多功能、可扩展的心脏监测解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

Motivation: 当前数字孪生技术缺乏实时实现的关键特性、模型不确定性关注不足，且缺乏清晰的模型与资产信息交换框架。

Method: 提出VDT框架，通过轻量级贝叶斯输出层和新型更新算法，实现快速更新和校准的不确定性边界。

Result: 在四个能源领域问题中验证，VDT显著提升了预测精度、数据效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: VDT将传统代理模型转化为具有不确定性感知、数据高效和计算可行的数字孪生，为能源系统提供了可靠模型。

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为社交媒体文本去毒提供了一种高效、泛化能力强且数据效率高的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Conclusion: 该研究为材料科学提供了一种无需结构输入、基于实验数据的通用模型路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based
models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for
computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world
applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain.
We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

Conclusion: 建议采取主动防洪措施（如改进排水系统、使用抗洪材料）以增强路面抗洪能力。

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop
explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of
Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models,
including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to
accurately categorize FOG episodes based on relevant clinical features. A
Stacking Ensemble model achieves superior performance, surpassing a hybrid
bidirectional GRU model and reaching nearly 99% classification accuracy. SHAP
interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential
factor in distinguishing gait patterns. Additionally, the proposed FOG
prediction framework incorporates federated learning, where models are trained
locally on individual devices and aggregated on a central server using a
federated averaging approach, utilizing a hybrid Conv1D + LSTM architecture for
enhanced predictive capability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D编码模块，通过旋转采样和SO(3)旋转群计算实现近似旋转不变性，并通过后对齐策略实现严格不变性，显著提升了分子属性预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 传统图表示难以有效编码分子的3D空间结构，现有方法在泛化性和计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于旋转采样的3D编码模块，结合SO(3)旋转群计算和后对齐策略。

Result: 在QM9和C10数据集上表现出更高的预测准确性、鲁棒性和泛化性能，同时保持低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物发现和材料设计中的3D分子信息处理提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks

Motivation: 探索基础模型在脑波建模中的潜力，评估其在BCI任务中的效率和适用性。

Method: 通过系统微调实验和LoRA技术，对LBMs在多个BCI任务（如记忆任务和睡眠阶段分类）中进行评估。

Result: LBMs仅比传统架构提升0.9%-1.2%，但参数需求显著增加；LoRA可减少参数而不降低性能。

Conclusion: 当前LBMs在脑波分析中效率不足，需领域特定优化和架构重新设计。

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在汽车通信系统等专业领域中效果有限，且缺乏针对ECU通信的LLM模型和不一致标注数据的复杂性。

Result: 提出了一种新的解码器异常检测架构，解决了标注不一致问题，并开发了适用于不同ECU通信用例的LLM模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成能力减少人工标注成本，提高了复杂通信环境中的检测准确性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在速度和准确性上均优于传统SGD，且具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM训练提供了一种高效且可扩展的优化方案。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information
generated during machine learning processes in PROV-JSON format, with minimal
code modifications.

Motivation: 急诊分诊中的错误（如过低或过高分诊）是持续挑战，AI的整合有望提升分诊准确性和效率。

Method: 通过回顾性分析7个月的急诊患者数据，训练并验证三种AI模型，评估其与FRENCH标准的一致性。

Result: LLM模型表现最佳（综合得分2.514），尤其在预测住院需求和结构化数据中表现稳健。

Conclusion: AI（尤其是LLM）可提升急诊分诊的准确性和效率，但需解决模型局限性和伦理问题。

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

Method: 引入PULSE协议，从预训练知识遗忘和长期可持续性两个维度评估现有遗忘方法。

Result: 现有方法能有效遗忘微调知识，但对预训练知识效果不佳；单次批量遗忘有效，但分步遗忘时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: PULSE协议为LMMs的遗忘能力提供了更全面的评估标准，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Result: 发现SGD仅能找到完美柏拉图解，且这种现象与渐进锐化有共同原因。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解SGD训练中“熵力”对表示学习的重要性，并揭示了两种看似无关现象的潜在联系。

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

Result: 证明了NHO在一般鞅驱动下的通用逼近能力，并分析了优化挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维随机控制问题提供了一种新的深度学习解决方案，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

Result: 发现追求梯度二阶矩无偏估计的直觉是错误的，“scale-then-privatize”技术表现更优，且噪声添加更符合实际需求。

Conclusion: “scale-then-privatize”技术在小规模语言模型训练中表现最佳，且噪声机制更实用。

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

Conclusion: ICLShield通过动态调整概念偏好比，有效提升LLMs对后门攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature.
However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Conclusion: TDNs作为现有网络的即插即用替代方案，在计算效率和性能上均表现出色。

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

Method: 采用双环动态课程学习架构，利用大语言模型的推理能力，逐步聚焦更具挑战性的样本。

Result: 在食品配送对话任务中，F1分数平均提升17.19%，OOD迁移测试中平均提升9.59%。

Conclusion: APARL为工业级异常检测模型提供了高效解决方案，提升了运营效率和商业价值。

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business
scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel
Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that
leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for
abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum
learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more
challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively
addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD
transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show
that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,
attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an
average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a
superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models,
contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH)的新方法，用于解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题，通过生成合成样本以保留拓扑特性并关注目标分布中未被充分代表的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学领域中，图结构数据普遍存在，但模型常面临不平衡学习问题，尤其是目标值范围偏好导致的研究空白。

Method: SMH方法通过生成合成图样本，保留拓扑特性并专注于目标分布中未被充分代表的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMH在化学和药物发现基准数据集上显著提升了目标域范围的预测性能。

Conclusion: SMH为解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效方法，尤其在关注特定目标范围时表现优异。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashDP是一种创新的缓存友好型DP-SGD方法，通过单次融合计算梯度，显著减少内存需求和冗余计算，同时保持隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，其训练数据的隐私保护成为关键问题。现有DP-SGD方法（如Opacus和GhostClip）在内存或计算效率上存在不足。

Method: FlashDP采用缓存友好的逐层DP-SGD，将必要操作整合为单任务，仅需一次融合计算梯度，减少内存移动和冗余计算。

Result: FlashDP在Llama-13B模型预训练中，内存需求不增加，吞吐量达到非DP方法的90%，且精度与标准DP-SGD相当。

Conclusion: FlashDP为高效且隐私保护的LLM训练提供了重要进展，其代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in

Motivation: 现有资源要么需要高级理论基础，要么关注神经网络架构而非几何特性，因此需要更直观的工具来解释扩散模型的几何特性。

Method: 开发了Diffusion Explorer，利用交互式动画展示扩散模型的动态系统特性。

Result: 用户可通过浏览器直接体验扩散模型的训练和采样过程，工具开源并提供在线演示。

Conclusion: Diffusion Explorer为理解和教学扩散模型的几何特性提供了直观且互动的方式。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video,
and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties
that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source
and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法使用单模态分布（如高斯分布）建模价值函数，易导致估计偏差和性能下降。

Method: 引入策略熵和价值分布函数，构建扩散价值网络，通过反向采样生成多峰分布，实现价值网络和策略网络的双扩散。

Conclusion: DSAC-D算法有效解决了价值函数估计偏差问题，实现了多模态策略学习，性能优于主流算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Motivation: 探索视觉和语言模型是否可以通过优化实现共享的统计模型，超越后验统计检测的对齐。

Method: 采用JAM框架，联合训练模态特定的自动编码器，结合重构和跨模态目标。

Result: 框架在三种设计轴上验证有效，能够可靠地诱导对齐，即使对于冻结的独立训练表示。

Conclusion: JAM框架为将通用单模态模型转化为专业多模态模型提供了理论和实践途径。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection
attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often
designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in
real time. In this work, we propose to evaluate and apply fast neural network
inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on
low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can
achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,
with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V的向量扩展（RVV）对AI工作负载加速具有潜力，但缺乏高效的自动调优框架，限制了其复杂AI工作负载的部署。

Method: 将RVV扩展集成到TVM的MetaSchedule框架中，利用概率性程序框架进行张量操作调优，并在FPGA上实现不同RISC-V SoC进行验证。

Result: 与GCC的自动向量化功能相比，执行延迟平均提升46%，比muRISCV-NN快29%，且代码内存占用更小。在商用RISC-V SoC上，比LLVM快35%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RISC-V RVV扩展的AI工作负载性能，适合嵌入式设备，并已开源供社区扩展。

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

Motivation: 解决移动设备资源有限与LLM微调需求之间的巨大差距，同时避免现有服务器辅助方法的高通信负担和数据隐私泄露问题。

Result: 减少了通信成本，加速了微调收敛，提高了计算效率，同时保护了数据和标签隐私。

Conclusion: PAE MobiLLM为移动设备上的LLM微调提供了一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: QNN在分类任务中表现更优，展示了量子机器学习在复杂数据分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine
learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly
required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

Result: 结果显示，当前最先进的子目标算法无法有效利用零激励动态，且学习性能对子目标与奖励的时间接近性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前方法存在根本性局限，需开发能推断潜在任务结构的新机制。

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

Result: 在多个数据集上，Dist-FedAvg优于基线方法，提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg在提升推荐效果的同时，保持了与现有联邦学习框架的无缝集成。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

Method: 提出Prefix-RFT，一种混合方法，结合了从演示数据学习和探索学习的优势。该方法在数学推理任务中进行了实证验证。

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT有效结合了SFT和RFT的互补性，为未来研究提供了一个统一范式。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable

highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However,
reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high
sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works
have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting
environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy
problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic
simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated
training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios
based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.
Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波的扩散模型（WDM），用于将降水数据从10公里分辨率降尺度到1公里，显著提升了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球降水数据（如IMERG）分辨率较低（10公里），无法满足水文建模和极端天气分析的需求。

Method: WDM是一种条件扩散模型，直接在小波域学习降水数据的复杂结构，专注于高频小波系数，生成1公里分辨率的降水场。

Result: WDM实现了10倍空间超分辨率，推理速度比基于像素的扩散模型快9倍，生成结果更真实且细节丰富。

Conclusion: WDM为地球科学超分辨率问题提供了准确且高效的解决方案，有助于更可靠的水文预报。

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

Result: 生成的适配器性能虽不及GPU训练版本，但优于基础模型，适合资源有限场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为CPU用户提供了一种实用的LoRA微调替代方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MetaStone-S1为研究社区提供了高效且可扩展的生成模型，并已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model
(SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for
next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with
only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have
open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.

Result: 实验表明，松弛变量的引入显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用量子优势构建高效替代模型提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在结合连续与离散任务中的学习能力，特别是其在上下文中的状态回忆与预测能力。

Method: 预训练Transformer模型于符号标记的随机线性确定性动态系统样本，分析其状态回忆与预测能力，并通过实验验证机制。

Result: 模型需两种机制完成任务：基于符号标签的关联回忆与基于上下文的贝叶斯式预测，且两种机制学习动态不同。

Conclusion: 多机制现象不仅限于玩具问题，类似现象在ICL翻译任务中也被观察到。

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

Result: 提供了BAR数据集，并展示了基于该数据集的分类结果。

Conclusion: BAR数据集填补了博物馆环境RSS数据的空白，为未来研究提供了基础和建议。

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential
research directions.

Method: 提出GradMetaNet架构，基于等变性设计、多数据点梯度处理和秩-1分解的高效表示。

Result: GradMetaNet能够逼近自然梯度函数，并在多种任务（如优化、编辑和曲率估计）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GradMetaNet为梯度处理提供了高效且通用的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在大型语言模型后训练中存在可扩展性瓶颈和资源利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出AsyncFlow框架，包括分布式数据存储与传输模块、异步工作流引擎，并与底层训练和推理引擎解耦。

Result: 实验显示吞吐量平均提升1.59倍。

Conclusion: AsyncFlow为下一代强化学习系统设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized
models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent
performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but
typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional
modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive
Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small
vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS
transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully
interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision,
audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized
methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or
requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at

Method: 将精确输入重构形式化为离散优化问题，提出SODA算法，通过梯度搜索和周期性重启等方法在连续松弛的输入空间中进行优化。

Result: 在33M到3B参数的LLM上实验表明，SODA显著优于现有方法，成功恢复了79.5%的短输入，但对长输入（15+ token）的隐私信息提取效果不佳。

Conclusion: 标准部署实践可能已足够防止恶意使用该方法，但SODA在短输入重构上表现出色。

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

Result: 实验证明RelFCI能有效识别具有潜在混杂因素的关系因果模型中的正确因果结构。

Conclusion: RelFCI填补了关系数据因果发现的空白，为实际应用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Result: zapping能帮助模型更快适应新领域；优化器选择会显著影响任务间的学习与遗忘动态，产生复杂的协同/干扰模式。

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择是影响持续学习动态的关键因素，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet

produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically
require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server

Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that

provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and

adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and

Result: 在四个数据集上实验表明，该方法优于现有在线方法，且分类准确性接近批量训练模型，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性上取得了平衡，适用于在线学习场景。

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based
sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped
to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual
dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel
algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update
mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low
computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains
show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary
learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of
batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

*Nicolas Salvy,Hugues Talbot,Bertrand Thirion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新指标（Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage），用于更可靠地评估生成模型样本的质量，解决了现有指标在鲁棒性和可解释性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在关键应用中的使用受到样本质量评估不可靠的限制，现有指标缺乏校准或对异常值的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过剪裁单个样本贡献和最近邻球的半径，提出Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage指标，防止分布外样本影响聚合值。

Result: 新指标在合成和真实数据集上表现出更高的鲁棒性、敏感性和可解释性。

Conclusion: Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage为生成模型的质量评估提供了更可靠和直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

Result: 在多类分类任务中，BranchNet显著优于XGBoost，准确率更高。

Conclusion: BranchNet在符号可解释性和性能上表现优异，但在二元任务中可能需要进一步优化。

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms
decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each
branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped
to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based
optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no
manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class
classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in
accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture,
training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in
symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on
binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

TL;DR: PERTINENCE是一种动态选择预训练模型的方法，通过遗传算法优化输入调度器，在保持精度的同时减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型DNN模型虽然精度高，但计算资源消耗大，需要在不显著降低精度的情况下减少对大型模型的依赖。

Method: 使用遗传算法训练输入调度器，动态选择最适合的预训练模型处理输入。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上，PERTINENCE在保持或提高精度的同时减少了36%的计算量。

Conclusion: PERTINENCE通过动态模型选择，实现了精度与计算效率的平衡，为资源受限场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph

Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of
the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose
Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph
Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise
attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model
explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading

improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

Motivation: 探索GNN在解决SAT问题中的潜力，并验证其理论性能和实际效果。

Method: 将k-CNF公式转换为MILP问题，编码为加权二分图后输入GNN进行训练和测试。

Result: 理论证明了方法的稳定性和局限性，实验结果显示其具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为GNN在SAT问题中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

TL;DR: mGRADE是一种混合内存系统，结合了1D卷积和最小门控循环单元，适用于内存受限的边缘设备进行多尺度时间处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需要同时捕获短时和长时动态的模型，但现有方法（如Transformer、RNN和TCN）在内存或效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出mGRADE，整合1D卷积和minGRU，卷积层实现灵活延迟嵌入，循环模块高效维护全局上下文。

Result: 在合成任务和图像分类基准测试中，mGRADE优于纯卷积和循环模型，内存占用减少20%。

Conclusion: mGRADE是内存受限边缘设备进行多尺度时间处理的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal
processing at the edge.

Result: 实验显示该方法在基准问题上优于集成方法，并与Adam和LBFGS结合的PINN集成竞争。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯PINN是解决PINN信息传播问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Conclusion: FAE为时间序列异常检测提供了一种通用的基础模型，具有零样本应用的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

Result: 现有方法在特定任务上表现良好，但在复杂模型和任务中效果下降。

Conclusion: 需关注算法选择和新兴方向（如可微调方法和元学习）以提升学习率控制效果。

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

Conclusion: SBI为1型糖尿病的生理模型参数估计提供了一种高效、可靠且计算成本低的方法。

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OOD检测方法依赖于监督模型的预测不确定性或特征，但这些方法无法正确识别OOD数据，因为分类器仅针对分布内数据训练。

Method: 通过分析不确定性方法和特征方法的局限性，探讨了其错误根源，并评估了现有改进方法的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，现有方法在OOD检测中存在不可减少的错误，且常见改进措施（如混合方法、模型扩展等）无法解决根本问题。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了OOD检测方法的根本局限性，指出需要新的方法来解决这一问题。

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如AdaLoRA）依赖损失函数的一阶近似，在LoRA参数优化良好时可能不准确且病态，因此需要更可靠的二阶方法。

Method: 将秩确定问题重新表述为组合优化问题，引入子模函数最大化框架和贪心算法，结合Hessian矩阵的闭式投影，实现高效计算。

Result: 在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的微调实验中，SubLoRA在秩确定和联合训练性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论基础、二阶准确性和计算效率，为LoRA秩确定提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成式零样本学习方法需要大量计算资源和合成数据，违背了零样本学习的初衷。FSIGenZ旨在减少这种依赖，同时处理属性在实例级别的变异性。

Method: 提出模型特定属性评分（MSAS）动态调整属性评分，估计组级原型作为未见类的代表性特征，并引入双重目的语义正则化（DPSR）训练语义感知对比分类器（SCC）。

Result: 在SUN、AwA2和CUB基准测试中，FSIGenZ使用更少的合成特征实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FSIGenZ通过动态属性评分和原型估计，有效减少了计算资源需求，同时保持了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBellQuant是一种创新的后训练量化框架，通过LTDB算法将权重分布转换为双钟形以减少量化误差，实现1位权重压缩和6位激活量化，性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）面临计算和内存挑战，量化是解决方案，但量化误差和激活异常值限制了其效果。

Method: 使用LTDB算法将单钟形权重分布转换为双钟形以减少二值化误差，并应用逆变换平滑激活。

Result: 在Wikitext2数据集上，DBellQuant在LLaMA2-13B上实现了14.39的困惑度，显著优于BiLLM的21.35。

Conclusion: DBellQuant在激进量化的同时保持模型性能，为LLMs的实际应用提供了高效压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

Result: 停止梯度和指数移动平均方法虽不优化原始目标函数，但能避免崩溃；线性情况下，原始目标函数会导致崩溃。

Conclusion: 停止梯度和指数移动平均方法的极限点是渐近稳定的平衡点，不会退化到平凡解。

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在病理视觉推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏领域知识且推理步骤可能引入错误。

Conclusion: PathCoT通过专家知识和自评估显著提升了病理视觉推理的准确性。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet
Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical
representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant
allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar
FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion
simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning
algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data
sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2.
Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries
were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine
learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of
each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the
selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced
through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden
layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal
model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons
respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications
spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and
recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units
(GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as
Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and
energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units
requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this
work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning
frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to
experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware,
providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的多视图动态决策框架，用于多组学数据分类，旨在降低测试成本的同时保持高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学技术成本高昂，可能导致资源浪费，因此需要一种方法在减少冗余测试的同时保持诊断准确性。

Method: 在单组学层面，通过改进神经网络激活函数生成Dirichlet分布参数，量化分类结果的置信度和不确定性；在多组学层面，基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合异构模态，动态决策逐步引入数据直至满足置信度阈值。

Result: 在四个多组学数据集上评估，50%以上的病例仅需单组学数据即可准确分类，显著减少冗余测试，同时保持与全组学模型相当的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低成本的同时保持了诊断准确性和生物学意义，为多组学数据分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have
proven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early
diagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a
significant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially
leading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we
propose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics
data classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while
minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient
recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with
processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore,
considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning
next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge

Motivation: 迭代式搜索启发式方法在解决VRP时存在大量冗余计算，因为解的大部分在迭代中保持稳定。

Method: 提出FSTA技术保留稳定解段，并引入L2Seg神经网络框架智能识别稳定与不稳定部分，设计了三种L2Seg变体。

Result: 在CVRP和VRPTW上的实验表明，L2Seg能将求解器加速高达7倍，且NAR与AR的协同效果最佳。

Conclusion: L2Seg是一个灵活框架，适用于传统、学习和混合求解器，并能支持广泛的VRP问题。

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy
controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work
that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,

foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

*Logan A. Burnett,Umme Mahbuba Nabila,Majdi I. Radaideh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种变分数字孪生（VDT）框架，通过贝叶斯输出层和高效更新算法解决现有数字孪生在实时性、模型不确定性和信息交换方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字孪生技术缺乏实时实现的关键特性、模型不确定性关注不足，且缺乏清晰的模型与资产信息交换框架。

Method: VDT框架在标准神经网络架构中增加了一个贝叶斯输出层，并采用了一种新的更新算法，使其能在普通GPU上快速更新并提供校准的不确定性边界。

Result: 在四个能源领域问题中验证了VDT的有效性，包括临界热通量预测、可再生能源发电预测、核反应堆瞬态冷却和锂离子电池建模，均表现出高效、鲁棒和不确定性感知的特点。

Conclusion: VDT通过轻量级贝叶斯增强和高效更新方案，将传统代理模型转化为不确定性感知、数据高效且计算可行的数字孪生，为工业和科学能源系统提供了可靠模型。

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

Motivation: 社交媒体上毒性内容的广泛传播对在线环境和公共讨论构成威胁，现有方法在去毒性能、语义保留和数据效率方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先在少量高质量平行数据上进行监督微调，然后利用未标注毒性数据和自定义奖励模型，通过Group Relative Policy Optimization训练LLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效解决了现有工作的权衡问题，实现了最先进的性能，并显著减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法在去毒任务中表现出色，具有更好的泛化能力和数据效率。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Result: 成功应用于电影帧的存储与序列检索，展示了在长序列建模、记忆增强和时间偏置注意力等方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该模型为长上下文任务提供了新思路，对自然语言处理、预测等领域具有潜在影响。

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Result: 预训练显著加速收敛（最高4.2倍），提升准确性和表示质量，多模态性能随数据规模扩展更优。

Conclusion: 为材料科学提供了一种无需结构输入、基于实验数据的通用模型路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based
models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for
computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world
applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain.
We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

Conclusion: 建议采取防洪措施，如改进排水系统和使用抗洪材料，以提高路面韧性。

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

Conclusion: 基础模型在罕见、突发性事件的预测中具有潜力，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop
explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of
Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models,
including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to
accurately categorize FOG episodes based on relevant clinical features. A

Conclusion: 该方法计算复杂度低且可解释性强，为药物发现和材料设计提供了高效处理3D分子信息的新方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks
run also through workflow management systems.

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成能力减少了人工标注成本，提高了复杂通信环境中的检测准确性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information
generated during machine learning processes in PROV-JSON format, with minimal

Motivation: 急诊分诊中的错误（如分诊不足或过度）是持续挑战，AI的引入可能提升分诊效率和安全性。

Method: 回顾性分析7个月的急诊患者数据，训练并验证三种AI模型，评估其与FRENCH金标准的吻合度。

Result: LLM模型（URGENTIAPARSE）表现最佳，尤其在预测住院需求和结构化数据上更稳健。

Conclusion: AI（尤其是LLM）可提升急诊分诊准确性，但需解决模型局限性和伦理问题。

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

*Tatsuki Kawakami,Kazuki Egashira,Atsuyuki Miyai,Go Irie,Kiyoharu Aizawa*

TL;DR: 论文提出了PULSE协议，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的遗忘技术，重点关注预训练知识遗忘和长期可持续性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遗忘基准仅关注单次遗忘操作的问题，提出更现实的遗忘场景评估框架。

Method: 引入PULSE协议，包括预训练知识遗忘和长期可持续性评估两个维度，评估现有遗忘方法。

Result: 现有技术能有效遗忘微调知识，但难以消除预训练信息；单次批量遗忘方法在多次操作中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: PULSE协议为LMMs的遗忘技术提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

TL;DR: 论文详细解释了Ziyin等人（2025）关于嵌入式深度线性网络模型（EDLN）的“完美”柏拉图表示假设（PRH）的证明，并展示了SGD训练下EDLN的柏拉图性。

Motivation: 探讨SGD训练下EDLN模型如何学习到柏拉图表示，并揭示其与渐进锐化的共同原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和证明，展示SGD训练下EDLN模型的柏拉图表示特性。

Result: 发现SGD仅找到完美的柏拉图解，且PRH可通过六种方式打破。柏拉图表示与渐进锐化有共同原因。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解SGD训练中“熵力”的重要性及其在表示学习中的作用。

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

Abstract: The scientific computation methods development in conjunction with artificial

between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this
direction. The study presents a neural operator based on the dynamic mode
decomposition algorithm (DMD), mapping functional spaces, which combines DMD

PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant
computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes

costs compared to traditional numerical methods. The approach has demonstrated
its efficiency through comparative analysis of performance with closest
analogues DeepONet and FNO in the heat equation, Laplaces equation, and Burgers

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维随机控制问题因维度灾难难以解决，传统动态编程方法效率低下。

Method: 通过定义神经哈密顿算子（NHO），将问题转化为前向-后向随机微分方程（FBSDEs），并用神经网络参数化反馈控制和值函数梯度。

Result: 证明了NHO在一般鞅驱动下的通用逼近能力，并分析了优化挑战。

Conclusion: NHO为高维随机控制问题提供了新的深度学习解决方案，具有理论和实践潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了差分隐私训练中球形噪声对自适应优化器的影响，发现现有方法在简单任务上的结论可能不适用于实际模型训练。通过理论分析和实证研究，发现“scale-then-privatize”方法优于其他变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私训练中的球形噪声会降低自适应优化器（如AdaGrad和Adam）的性能，现有研究多基于简单任务，结论可能不具普适性。

Method: 调查了多种改进方法，通过理论分析和实证研究比较其性能，重点关注“scale-then-privatize”技术。

Result: 发现追求梯度二阶矩无偏估计的直觉是错误的，“scale-then-privatize”方法在理论和实践中表现更优。

Conclusion: “scale-then-privatize”方法不仅理论行为更优，且在小规模语言模型训练任务中表现最佳，更适合实际应用。

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL因其适应性和无参数特性在LLMs中表现优异，但也易受后门攻击，需研究防御方法。

Method: 提出双学习假说，理论分析后门效应上限，设计ICLShield机制，通过置信度和相似度动态选择干净样本。

Result: 实验表明ICLShield在多种LLMs和任务中表现最优，平均提升26.02%，对闭源模型（如GPT-4）也有效。

Conclusion: 双学习假说和ICLShield为ICL后门攻击提供了理论支持和实用防御方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature.
However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Motivation: 现有的SO(3)-等变网络在机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）中占主导地位，但其关键操作Clebsch-Gordan张量积计算成本高，亟需优化。

Method: 提出张量分解网络（TDNs），用低秩张量分解（如CP分解）替代Clebsch-Gordan张量积，并引入路径权重共享进一步减少参数。

Result: 在PubChemQCR、OC20和OC22数据集上，TDNs在保持性能的同时显著加速计算，复杂度从O(L^6)降至O(L^4)。

Conclusion: TDNs是一种高效且性能优异的SO(3)-等变网络替代方案，适用于大规模分子模拟任务。

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

Conclusion: APARL为异常检测模型的工业部署提供了高效解决方案，提升了运营效率和商业价值。

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business
scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel
Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that
leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for
abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum
learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more
challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively
addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD
transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show
that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,
attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an
average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a
superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models,
contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Motivation: 图结构数据在科学领域中普遍存在，但现有研究在处理不平衡回归问题时往往忽略特定目标值范围的重要性，导致模型偏向于平均目标值。

Result: 实验结果表明，SMH在化学和药物发现基准数据集上显著提高了目标域范围的预测性能。

Conclusion: SMH为解决图结构数据中的不平衡回归问题提供了一种有效的方法，尤其适用于科学领域中的关键目标值范围。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，其训练数据的隐私保护成为关键问题。现有的差分隐私（DP）方法如DP-SGD在实现时面临内存占用大或计算冗余的挑战。

Method: FlashDP提出了一种缓存友好的逐层DP-SGD方法，将必要操作合并为单一任务，仅需一次融合计算梯度，减少内存移动和冗余计算。

Result: FlashDP在Llama-13B模型预训练中，内存需求未增加，吞吐量达到非DP方法的90%，同时与标准DP-SGD保持相同的准确性。

Conclusion: FlashDP为高效且隐私保护的LLM训练提供了重要进展，其代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in

Abstract: Diffusion models have been central to the development of recent image, video,
and even text generation systems. They posses striking geometric properties
that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source
and a live demo is available at alechelbling.com/Diffusion-Explorer.

Conclusion: DSAC-D通过扩散模型和熵优化，有效解决了值函数估计偏差问题，实现了多模态策略表示和性能提升，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Conclusion: 该框架为将通用单模态模型转化为专业多模态模型提供了理论和实践途径。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection

achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,

*Federico Nicolas Peccia,Frederik Haxel,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于TVM编译器的工作流，用于高效地将AI工作负载映射到RISC-V向量单元，相比现有方法显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V的向量扩展（RVV）在AI工作负载加速中具有潜力，但缺乏智能方法（如自动调优框架）的集成，限制了其高效部署。

Method: 将RVV扩展集成到TVM的MetaSchedule框架中，并通过FPGA实现不同的RISC-V SoC，对多种AI工作负载进行调优。

Result: 相比GCC的自动向量化功能，平均执行延迟提升了46%；相比muRISCV-NN，提升了29%。同时，生成的二进制代码占用更少内存。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RISC-V上AI工作负载的执行效率，并开源以支持社区扩展。

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

TL;DR: PAE MobiLLM是一种隐私保护且高效的移动设备大语言模型微调方法，通过服务器辅助的侧调优和激活缓存技术，解决了通信负担和数据隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备资源有限，现有服务器辅助方法存在通信负担重和数据隐私泄露问题。

Method: 采用服务器辅助侧调优、激活缓存、单令牌激活快捷方式和加法适配器侧网络设计。

Result: 减少了通信成本，加速了微调收敛，提高了计算效率，同时保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: PAE MobiLLM为移动设备上的大语言模型微调提供了一种高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Motivation: 利用量子计算解决机器学习中的高维数据表示问题，特别是在智能交通系统中模拟行人压力的SCR事件。

Method: 开发了基于Pennylane的QSVM（使用八量子位ZZ特征图）和QNN（使用树张量网络结构和八量子位ZZ特征图）。

Conclusion: QNN在分类任务中表现更优，展现了量子机器学习在复杂数据建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine
learning tasks, for instance, high-dimensional data representations commonly
required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

TL;DR: 研究发现奖励频率不能可靠衡量任务难度，揭示了当前强化学习方法在未直接奖励关键子目标时的局限性。

Motivation: 重新验证奖励频率作为任务难度指标的假设，并探讨未直接奖励关键子目标对策略学习的影响。

Method: 形式化零激励动态问题，分析现有深度子目标算法在此类动态中的表现。

Result: 现有算法无法有效利用零激励动态，学习性能对子目标完成与最终奖励的时间接近性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在根本性局限，需开发能推断潜在任务结构而不依赖即时奖励的机制。

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过程强化学习中引入额外过程奖励模型带来的计算开销和缺乏统一理论框架的问题。

Method: 提出SPRO框架，包括内在推导过程奖励和定义累积过程奖励与掩码步骤优势（MSA）。

Result: SPRO在训练效率上比GRPO高3.4倍，测试准确率提升17.5%，同时减少响应长度约1/3。

Conclusion: SPRO在提升性能的同时避免了额外计算开销，适合工业应用。

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

Motivation: 传统聚合方法未考虑用户嵌入的复杂性和用户相似性在推荐中的关键作用，且缺乏对高相关性锚用户的适应性保护。

Method: 提出Dist-FedAvg，通过为相似嵌入用户分配更高权重，并保持锚用户在本地更新中的影响力，优化聚合过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Dist-FedAvg在推荐准确性上优于基线方法，且易于集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg有效解决了图联邦推荐系统中的聚合问题，提升了推荐效果和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

Motivation: 现有的SFT和RFT方法各有优缺点，SFT容易过度模仿演示数据，而RFT性能不稳定且可能学习到意外行为。论文旨在统一这两种方法，提出更优的解决方案。

Method: 提出Prefix-RFT，一种结合演示和探索学习的混合方法，通过数学推理任务验证其有效性。

Result: Prefix-RFT在性能上超越了单独的SFT和RFT，且对演示数据的质量和数量变化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT展示了统一SFT和RFT的潜力，为未来LLM后训练研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable
energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested,
highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However,
reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high
sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works
have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting
environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy
problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic
simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated
training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios
based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.
Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over
100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular
architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station
configurations.

Conclusion: BBoxER是梯度优化的轻量级补充，适用于隐私敏感或受限环境。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

Conclusion: WDM为地球科学超分辨率中的精度和速度挑战提供了可靠解决方案，有助于更可靠的水文预报。

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language

widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which

next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified

for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Conclusion: 多机制现象（表现为分离的相变）不仅限于玩具问题，在ICL翻译任务中也观察到类似现象。

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

Motivation: 文化遗址中的IPS可以提升游客体验，但缺乏针对博物馆环境的公开RSS数据集阻碍了相关算法的开发与评估。

Result: 提供了BAR数据集，并展示了基于该数据集的分类基线结果。

Conclusion: BAR数据集填补了博物馆环境RSS数据的空白，为未来研究提供了基础和建议。

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In

### [169] [GradMetaNet: An Equivariant Architecture for Learning on Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01649)
*Yoav Gelberg,Yam Eitan,Aviv Navon,Aviv Shamsian,Theo,Putterman,Michael Bronstein,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GradMetaNet的新架构，专门设计用于处理梯度，基于三个原则：等变性设计、多数据点梯度处理和高效梯度表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未专门设计用于梯度处理，限制了其适用性。

Method: 基于等变性设计、多数据点梯度处理和高效梯度表示（秩1分解）构建GradMetaNet。

Result: GradMetaNet能逼近自然梯度函数，并在多种任务（如优化、编辑和曲率估计）中表现优异。

Conclusion: GradMetaNet为梯度处理提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为强大的生成模型，其损失函数的选择是关键问题。本文旨在探索不同目标目标及其对应的损失函数，以提供统一的理解。

Result: 研究发现不同损失函数在性能上存在差异，并揭示了影响这些差异的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 本研究为扩散模型的损失函数提供了统一视角，有助于未来更高效和目标导向的模型设计。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AsyncFlow是一个异步流式强化学习框架，用于高效的后训练，解决了传统RL框架的可扩展性和资源利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL框架在扩展性和资源利用上存在瓶颈，且与LLM训练或推理引擎紧密耦合，难以支持自定义引擎。

Method: 提出分布式数据存储和传输模块，实现统一数据管理和细粒度调度；采用生产者-消费者异步工作流，减少计算闲置。

Result: 实验显示吞吐量平均提升1.59倍。

Conclusion: AsyncFlow为下一代RL训练系统设计提供了模块化和可定制的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

TL;DR: MARVIS是一种无需训练的方法，通过将潜在嵌入空间转换为视觉表示，利用视觉语言模型的空间和细粒度推理能力，实现多模态数据的高精度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业模型灵活性不足和基础模型在非传统模态及长尾领域表现不佳的问题。

Method: 将潜在嵌入空间转换为视觉表示，利用视觉语言模型进行推理。

Result: 在视觉、音频、生物和表格领域表现优异，平均性能超越Gemini 16%，接近专业方法。

Conclusion: MARVIS提供了一种无需训练、保护隐私的多模态预测解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized
models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent
performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but
typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional
modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive
Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small
vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS
transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully
interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision,
audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized
methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or
requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at

*Adrians Skapars,Edoardo Manino,Youcheng Sun,Lucas C. Cordeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SODA的算法，用于从大型语言模型（LLM）输出中精确重构输入，解决了现有审计技术的补充问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计技术专注于识别LLM中的潜在不良行为，而本文则致力于解决事后分析的输入重构问题，以检测虚假输出报告。

Method: 将输入重构问题形式化为离散优化问题，提出SODA算法，通过梯度搜索和周期性重启等技术在连续松弛空间中高效求解。

Result: 在33M至3B参数的LLM上实验表明，SODA显著优于现有方法，成功重构79.5%的短输入，但对长输入（15+ token）的隐私信息提取效果不佳。

Conclusion: 标准部署实践可能已足够防范恶意使用SODA算法，但需进一步研究长输入的保护措施。

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有因果发现算法在处理关系数据和潜在混杂因素时存在不足，需要新方法。

Method: 基于FCI和RCD算法，定义新图形模型，支持关系数据中的因果发现。

Result: 实验证明RelFCI能有效识别含潜在混杂因素的关系因果模型。

Conclusion: RelFCI填补了关系数据因果发现的空白，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索zapping在持续学习和迁移学习中的有效性及其背后的机制。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络在挑战性场景（如持续学习和少样本迁移学习）中训练，分析学习和遗忘模式。

Result: zapping能加速模型适应新领域；优化器选择显著影响任务间的学习动态，导致复杂的协同/干扰模式。

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择对持续学习和迁移学习的动态有重要影响，需进一步研究其机制。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

Conclusion: FL为隐私增强的室内定位提供了可行解决方案，推动了安全高效室内定位系统的发展。

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often
produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically
require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server
reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor
localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor
localization systems.

Conclusion: Muon优化器在理论和实验上均表现出色，权重衰减和临界批量大小的分析为其实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that
leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We
provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and
without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that
adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and
gradient norms, and we clarify the relationship between the weight decay
coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive Muon's critical batch
size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is
the stochastic computational cost, and validate our theoretical findings with
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线核稀疏表示字典学习的高效性问题，同时保持分类准确性。

Method: 使用递归最小二乘法（RLS）递归更新字典，支持单样本或小批量处理，计算复杂度低。

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优于现有在线方法，分类准确率接近批量训练模型，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性上取得了平衡，适用于在线学习场景。

Abstract: We propose an efficient online dictionary learning algorithm for kernel-based
sparse representations. In this framework, input signals are nonlinearly mapped
to a high-dimensional feature space and represented sparsely using a virtual
dictionary. At each step, the dictionary is updated recursively using a novel
algorithm based on the recursive least squares (RLS) method. This update
mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low
computational complexity. Experiments on four datasets across different domains
show that our method not only outperforms existing online kernel dictionary
learning approaches but also achieves classification accuracy close to that of
batch-trained models, while remaining significantly more efficient.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新指标（Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage），用于更可靠、可解释地评估生成模型样本质量，解决了现有指标在鲁棒性和校准方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在关键应用中因样本质量评估不可靠而受限，现有指标缺乏校准和对异常值的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过剪裁单个样本贡献和最近邻球半径，防止异常样本影响整体评估，并通过分析和经验校准使指标线性退化。

Result: 新指标在合成和真实数据集上表现出更强的鲁棒性、敏感性和可解释性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage为生成模型样本质量评估提供了更可靠和直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

TL;DR: PERTINENCE是一种动态选择预训练模型的方法，通过输入特征复杂度分析，平衡计算效率和准确性，减少操作次数达36%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型DNN模型虽然准确但资源消耗高，需设计方法在保持精度的同时减少对大型模型的依赖。

Method: 使用遗传算法训练输入分配器，动态选择最适合的预训练模型处理输入。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上，PERTINENCE在保持或提高精度的同时，操作次数减少达36%。

Conclusion: PERTINENCE通过动态模型选择，有效平衡了计算效率和准确性，为资源优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph
Convolutional Networks and the accuracy of the models at the same time.
Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of
the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose
Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph
Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise
attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model
explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading

improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

Motivation: 探索GNN在解决SAT问题中的应用，结合MILP技术，提升GNN的通用性和表现。

Method: 将k-CNF公式转为MILP问题，编码为加权二分图，输入GNN训练和测试，并引入随机节点初始化（RNI）。

Result: 理论证明方法对重排序和等价性稳定，但对可折叠公式有限制；实验显示方法简单但效果良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN解决SAT问题提供了新思路，理论证明其潜力，实验验证其可行性。

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

TL;DR: mGRADE是一种混合内存系统，结合了1D卷积和最小门控循环单元，适用于内存受限的边缘设备，能有效处理多尺度时间特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备需要同时捕捉短时和长时动态的模型，但现有方法（如Transformer、RNN、TCN）在内存或效率上存在不足。

Method: 提出mGRADE，结合1D卷积和minGRU，卷积层实现灵活延迟嵌入，循环模块高效维护全局上下文。

Result: 在合成任务和像素级图像分类任务中，mGRADE表现优于纯卷积和纯循环模型，内存占用减少20%。

Conclusion: mGRADE是内存受限边缘设备中多尺度时间处理的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal

Result: 实验表明该方法在基准问题上优于集成方法，并与Adam和LBFGS组合训练的PINN集成竞争。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯PINN是一种数学上更严谨的方法，能有效改进PINN的信息传播性能。

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Motivation: 受大型预训练基础模型成功的启发，研究如何利用VAEs和DCNNs构建通用时间序列模型，以解决异常检测问题。

Method: 结合变分自编码器（VAEs）和膨胀卷积神经网络（DCNNs），构建FAE模型，进行大规模预训练。

Result: 在多维时间序列数据集（包括移动ISP数据和KDD 2021数据集）上展示了初步结果。

Conclusion: FAE为时间序列异常检测提供了一种通用、零样本的解决方案，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率是深度学习的关键超参数，但其控制方法在不同任务和模型中的可靠性不足，需探索更普适的解决方案。

Method: 比较了多保真超参数优化、固定学习率调度和无超参数学习等方法，分析了它们在深度学习任务中的表现。

Result: 现有方法在特定任务上表现良好，但在复杂模型和任务中效果下降，需算法选择和新兴方向如元学习。

Conclusion: AutoML社区需关注更相关的测试任务和新兴方向（如可微调方法和元学习），以提升学习率控制的效果。

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

Motivation: 传统方法在高维参数空间中效率低且计算成本高，难以处理葡萄糖-胰岛素相互作用的复杂性。

Method: 采用基于神经后验估计的模拟推理方法，捕捉饮食、胰岛素和血糖水平的复杂关系。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在参数估计上优于传统方法，且能泛化到未见条件，提供实时后验推断。

Conclusion: 该方法为1型糖尿病数字孪生提供了高效、可靠的参数估计和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: 采用混合深度学习模型（LSTM+Transformer），结合iForest和AE进行伪标记，并在两个真实心理健康账单数据集上评估。

Result: iForest LSTM基线在声明级数据上召回率最高（0.963）；混合iForest模型在操作级数据上召回率最高（0.744），但精度较低。

Conclusion: 伪标记与混合深度学习结合在复杂、不平衡的异常检测场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based
reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large
world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently
distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact
model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving
performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a
state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M

our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task
knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training
quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical
deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法依赖监督模型的不确定性或特征，但这些方法无法正确识别OOD数据，甚至可能产生误导性结果。

Method: 通过分析不确定性方法和特征方法的局限性，探讨了其错误根源，并评估了改进方法的无效性。

Result: 研究发现现有方法在OOD检测中存在不可约误差，且常见改进措施无法解决根本问题。

Conclusion: 论文指出OOD检测需要重新思考方法设计，现有技术存在本质缺陷。

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

TL;DR: SubLoRA提出了一种基于子模函数最大化的LoRA秩确定方法，利用二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）改进现有方法的不足，并通过贪心算法实现高效计算。实验表明其在PINN微调中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如AdaLoRA）依赖一阶近似，在LoRA参数优化良好时表现不佳，因此需要更可靠且精确的二阶方法。

Method: 将秩确定问题转化为组合优化问题，引入子模函数最大化框架，设计贪心算法，并扩展至联合优化设置。

Result: SubLoRA在秩确定和联合训练性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论严谨性、二阶精度和计算效率，为LoRA秩确定提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个新基准，用于评估基于LLM的多智能体系统中隐含的社会偏见和刻板印象。通过场景评估和两阶段评分，研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体，而非真正中立。


<details>

Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM中的隐性偏见，引发公平性和代表性担忧，需开发评估工具。

Method: MALIBU通过场景任务和两阶段评分（单响应评分和成对比较）评估LLM输出的偏见。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能过度偏向边缘化群体，而非实现真正中立，需更细致的公平策略。

Conclusion: 需开发透明、平衡的评估基准和策略，以减少多智能体系统中的偏见。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖人工摘要作为黄金标准，但忽略了事件信息的完整性，因此需要更全面的评估方式。

Result: 方法能更深入分析摘要中包含的事件信息。

Conclusion: 基于事件重叠的评估方法提供了更全面的摘要质量分析。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

Conclusion: 研究展示了百科全书内容如何反映社会历史变迁，数据和方法公开可用。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MEGA的新框架，结合双向mLSTM和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），通过多头指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）优化ABSA任务中的局部和全局依赖建模，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率与高性能之间难以平衡，深度学习模型缺乏全局上下文，Transformer计算资源需求高，而Mamba方法存在CUDA依赖和局部相关性不足的问题。xLSTM在长程依赖建模上的潜力尚未在ABSA中充分探索。

Method: 提出xLSTM结合多头指数门控融合（MEGA），采用双向mLSTM架构和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），并引入MECGAF机制动态融合前向和反向输出，优化局部依赖捕获。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGA在ABSA任务中优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架通过创新的双向流和融合机制，有效解决了ABSA任务中的局部与全局依赖平衡问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关属性（如文本来源或语言）的干扰，影响多语料库文本的应用效果。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除混杂因素信息。

Result: 去偏算法显著减少了偏差，提升了文档相似性和聚类度量，且不影响分布外基准性能。

Conclusion: 去偏算法高效且有效，能在不降低嵌入质量的情况下减少偏差。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the

model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

TL;DR: CARE-RAG 是一个新框架，通过冲突驱动的证据总结提升 RAG 系统的可靠性，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决 RAG 系统中因知识冲突导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出 CARE-RAG 框架，包括参数感知证据提取、上下文感知证据优化、冲突驱动总结和 QA 修复步骤。

Result: 在噪声或冲突证据场景下，CARE-RAG 表现优于现有 RAG 基线。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG 通过冲突驱动总结显著提升了 RAG 系统的可靠性和生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

TL;DR: 论文提出CompactDS，一个高质量、多样化的网络规模数据存储，显著提升了检索增强生成（RAG）在推理密集型任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG在推理密集型任务中表现有限，主要原因是缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的数据存储。

Method: 引入CompactDS，通过过滤低质量内容并结合内存近似最近邻（ANN）检索和磁盘精确搜索，实现高效检索。

Result: CompactDS在所有基准测试（MMLU、MMLU Pro、GPQA、MATH）中均带来显著性能提升，相对增益达10%-33%。

Conclusion: CompactDS证明了高质量多样化数据存储的重要性，其性能优于现有复杂系统，且具备简单性和可复现性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种新的激活稀疏化方法，通过层间正交旋转和Top-K选择，提升LLM效率，无需额外训练或基于幅度的剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在恢复训练耗时或基于幅度的剪枝导致稀疏性波动的问题，LaRoSA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现一致的稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏性下，LaRoSA仅增加0.17困惑度，加速1.30倍，零样本任务准确率差距降至0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA在各种LLM上表现优异，稀疏化效果稳定且性能损失小。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在捕捉人类偏好方面表现不佳，主要原因是偏好数据集范围狭窄、标注质量不足。

Method: 设计人机协同的两阶段数据标注流程，结合人类标注质量与AI扩展性，训练了从0.6B到8B参数的奖励模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在多个能力维度上表现优异，包括对齐人类偏好、安全性等，并在七个主要基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据和人机协同标注，Skywork-Reward-V2系列显著提升了奖励模型的性能，展示了现有偏好数据集的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

Conclusion: 该框架为处理真实临床文本提供了高效算法基础，对多标签医学文本建模任务具有实际意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练的检索式推测解码方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit推测后续token并扩展检索范围，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式推测解码方法因匹配范式限制，难以找到准确匹配的参考token，导致性能受限。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成推测token：(1)利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个token；(2)检索与推测token相关的参考token。

Result: 实验表明，LogitSpec在多个文本生成任务中最高实现2.61倍加速，平均每解码步骤接受3.28个token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec是一种高效、即插即用的推测解码方法，显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM文本简化系统缺乏个性化，未能满足目标群体（如智力障碍人士）的具体需求。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和直接偏好优化（DPO）技术，结合目标群体的偏好反馈进行模型训练。

Result: 研究结果表明，目标群体的积极参与对设计符合人类期望的个性化AI解决方案至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化包容性AI系统提供了新思路，强调了目标群体直接参与的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中对未见或模糊查询的鲁棒性问题，确保系统在实际部署中的可靠性。

Method: 首先对现有意图分类器的输出进行不确定性估计，然后对高不确定性实例触发微调的LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，包括从实际部署系统中获取的真实OOS数据。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了平衡，结合传统方法和LLM，为OOS检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

Motivation: 探讨外部信息是否对LLMs在立场检测任务中有益，尽管此前研究表明其对BERT类模型有提升作用。

Method: 系统评估维基百科和网络搜索信息对8种LLMs在3个数据集（12个目标）中的立场检测性能影响。

Result: 外部信息通常降低性能，LLMs倾向于根据提供的信息而非文本真实立场进行预测。微调可缓解但无法完全消除问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在立场检测中的信息偏见风险，与BERT类模型的研究结果形成对比。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

Result: 实验表明，结合LLM和结构化奖励模型能提升系统的韧性和情感响应能力。

Conclusion: LUSTER为下一代对话系统提供了一种实用路径。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

Motivation: 随着指令调优神经语言模型的发展，NLP评估逐渐从全局评分转向成对比较。本文旨在为选择评估策略提供依据。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优劣，需根据具体场景选择评估策略。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

Method: 使用印尼单语BERT、多语言模型（mBERT、XLM-R）和适配器方法MAD-X，对十种本地语言进行零样本和适配器迁移评估，并将语言分为三类（已见、部分见、未见）。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言表现最佳，部分见次之，未见最差；MAD-X显著提升性能，尤其是已见和部分见语言。语言暴露程度是迁移成功的最强预测因素。

Conclusion: 模型在预训练中对目标语言或其相关语言的暴露程度是迁移性能的关键因素，适配器方法（如MAD-X）能有效提升低资源语言的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

TL;DR: 提出AdamMeme框架，通过多智能体协作动态评估多模态大语言模型（mLLMs）对有害模因的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态数据集的评估方法无法适应动态演变的在线模因，需更灵活、全面的评估框架。

Method: 采用多智能体协作的AdamMeme框架，动态更新模因数据以测试mLLMs的推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，AdamMeme能系统揭示不同mLLMs的性能差异及其弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为mLLMs的有害模因理解提供了深入、细粒度的评估工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Lbotirx/AdamMeme.

*Aditya Tomar,Rudra Murthy,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出StereoBias数据集，通过联合学习偏见和刻板印象检测任务提升模型性能，实验表明联合训练显著优于单独训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能造成危害，尤其在敏感领域如内容审核和决策中。

Method: 引入StereoBias数据集，比较编码器模型和解码器模型（使用QLoRA微调），并联合训练偏见和刻板印象检测任务。

Result: 联合训练显著提升偏见检测性能，解码器模型表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息有助于构建更公平有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

*Oliver Wardas,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了NLP在法律文本中的应用，通过扩展数据集和使用LLM评估德国雇佣合同条款的合法性，发现法律上下文对模型性能有显著影响，但LLM表现仍不及人类律师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战和机会，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，探索使用LLM和上下文学习评估合同条款的合法性，比较不同法律上下文（无上下文、全文法律来源、简化版指南）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 全文法律来源对性能有中等提升，而简化版指南显著提高了无效条款的召回率和加权F1分数（达80%），但LLM表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLM在合同合法性审查中有辅助潜力，但现有方法仍有局限性，贡献了扩展数据集和相关资源。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

Motivation: 研究分词差异如何影响语言数据的表示和分析结果的有效性，特别是在处理表情符号和同形异义词时。

Method: 通过研究表情符号和同形异义词的挑战，提出预处理方法以确保数字文本在语料库中的准确表示。

Result: 研究发现，预处理表情符号和同形异义词对保持语料库与源数据的忠实性至关重要，支持可靠的语料分析。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在数字文本数据处理中理解语言和技术细节的重要性，对语料库研究的定量和定性方法具有重要影响。

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,
and have significant implications for both quantitative and qualitative
approaches in corpus-based research.

Motivation: 现有数据质量评估方法主要针对英语，缺乏多语言支持，限制了非英语数据的模型表现。

Method: MuRating通过聚合多个英语评分器的信号，学习统一文档质量评分，并通过翻译将这些评分投射到目标语言，训练多语言评估器。

Result: MuRating在英语和多语言基准测试中均显著提升模型性能，尤其在知识密集型任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: MuRating为多语言数据质量评估提供了有效解决方案，同时指出了翻译保真度和叙事材料代表性等未来研究方向。

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Motivation: 探讨评估意识对AI治理框架和行业自愿承诺的影响，揭示当前评估方法的潜在问题。

Method: 使用线性探针分析Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct模型，区分评估与部署提示。

Result: 线性探针能有效分离评估与部署提示，且当前安全评估被模型视为不真实。

Conclusion: 需确保评估的可信度，理解模型的欺骗能力，并利用模型内部信息支持安全审计。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

Motivation: 理解多模态模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，探索其内部表征结构和注意力机制的影响。

Method: 通过向视觉-语言模型提供不一致的输入（如图像与标题矛盾），观察模型对不同模态的偏好及其内部机制。

Result: 模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，且内部注意力头可调整表征偏好；发现模态无关的“路由头”可优化性能。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型在冲突信号中的行为提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Motivation: 自动医疗编码可简化文档和计费流程，但需透明性，现有评估因数据稀缺受限。

Method: 深入分析MDACE数据集，评估现有可解释医疗编码系统的合理性。

Result: 真实证据与代码描述部分一致，先进方法与真实证据高度重叠。

Conclusion: 提出匹配度量，总结成功与失败案例，为开发可解释医疗编码系统提供建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Motivation: 为隐私敏感的临床环境中语言模型的部署提供格式选择和提示设计的实用指导。

Method: 评估三种序列化格式（JSON、YAML、XML）的解析性能，分析错误模式。

Result: JSON解析性能最优，结构鲁棒性随提示优化和模型增大而提升，但对长文档和特定笔记类型下降。

Conclusion: JSON是临床笔记中语言模型输出的最佳序列化格式选择。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

Method: 提出了一种系统方法，专注于分析低困惑度序列（高概率文本片段），可靠地提取这些序列并追踪其训练数据来源。

Result: 发现大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练语料库，对匹配序列的分布进行了量化分析。

Conclusion: 研究为理解训练数据如何影响模型行为提供了新视角，有助于改进模型的透明度和问责制。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

Conclusion: DIY-MKG有效解决了多语言学习中的问题，具有实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

Motivation: 解决小语言模型在长推理任务中的学习能力不足问题。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B和3B模型在多个基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MiCoTA为小语言模型的长推理蒸馏提供了有效方法，并启发了未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

Result: 在多个LLM和27个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成任务中显著优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能剪枝和校准策略，有效提升了模型性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor

Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 通过从教师模型中选择高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），提升学生模型的推理能力，优于随机采样和现有数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究教师模型提供的推理演示中哪些类型最有效，以提升学生模型的推理能力。

Method: 从教师模型中筛选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析样本效率和可扩展性，并比较随机采样与选择困难样本的效果。

Result: NaturalThoughts在Llama和Qwen模型上优于现有数据集，尤其在需要多样推理策略的任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 选择高质量且多样化的推理样本能更高效地提升学生模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策效果的文本生成评估框架，发现传统评估方法与实际决策效果相关性较弱，而人类与LLM协作能显著提升决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的内在评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与实际决策效果相关性较弱，需要更直接的评估方式。

Method: 通过市场摘要文本（包括客观的早间总结和主观的收盘分析）测试人类投资者和LLM代理的决策质量。

Result: 人类和LLM代理单独依赖摘要时表现不优于随机；但结合更丰富的分析评论后，人类-LLM协作团队显著优于单独个体。

Conclusion: 评估生成文本应关注其促进人类与LLM协同决策的能力，传统内在指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

Abstract: In recent years, neural models trained on large multilingual text and speech
datasets have shown great potential for supporting low-resource languages. This
study investigates the performances of two state-of-the-art Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) models, OpenAI's Whisper (Small & Large-V2) and Facebook's
Wav2Vec-BERT on Bangla, a low-resource language. We have conducted experiments
using two publicly available datasets: Mozilla Common Voice-17 and OpenSLR to
evaluate model performances. Through systematic fine-tuning and hyperparameter
optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,
we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error
Rate (CER), Training Time, and Computational Efficiency. The Wav2Vec-BERT model
outperformed Whisper across all key evaluation metrics, demonstrated superior
performance while requiring fewer computational resources, and offered valuable
insights to develop robust speech recognition systems in low-resource
linguistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在辩论中的表现及其对对话结构的理解能力。

Method: 通过测试LLMs的辩论能力和对对话结构的理解。

Result: LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论，但无法理解深层对话结构。

Conclusion: LLMs的辩论能力不依赖于对内容的理解，实用性和连贯性比理解更重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM中的隐性偏见，引发公平和代表性担忧，需开发评估工具。

Method: MALIBU通过两阶段评估：1）对标注人口特征的响应评分；2）比较不同人口特征的响应。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体而非真正中立，需更细致的检测和公平策略。

Conclusion: 需透明评估基准和平衡公平策略以优化多智能体系统的公平性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖与人工参考摘要的重叠单元或相似性得分，但新闻摘要应反映事件信息，因此需要更直接的事件信息评估方法。

Method: 提出计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文之间的事件重叠，并在挪威语数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能更深入地分析摘要中的事件信息。

Conclusion: 基于事件重叠的评估方法能更准确地反映生成摘要的质量。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

Motivation: 研究目的是揭示19世纪末至20世纪初瑞典知识界对地理关注的变化，反映历史事件（如第一次世界大战）的影响。

Method: 使用数字化文本，通过语义句子嵌入匹配条目，并利用基于Transformer的分类器提取地理条目，链接到Wikidata进行分析。

Result: 发现地理焦点从欧洲转向其他地区，证实了第一次世界大战和新势力崛起的影响。

Conclusion: 研究验证了历史事件对百科全书内容的影响，提供了数据和方法支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MEGA的新框架，结合xLSTM和Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion，用于提升Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis（ABSA）的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA方法在计算效率与高性能之间难以平衡，xLSTM的潜力在ABSA中尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出MEGA框架，整合双向mLSTM架构和部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），并引入多头交叉指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MEGA优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架有效解决了ABSA任务中的局部与全局依赖建模问题，同时提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关属性（如来源或语言）的干扰，影响多语料库文本的应用效果。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中去除混杂因素信息。

Result: 在所有评估的嵌入变体和任务中，文档相似性和聚类指标均显著提升，且不影响分布外基准性能。

Conclusion: 去偏算法能有效减少文本相似性度量中的偏差，且不损害嵌入的其他性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base

non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）在眼科中模拟临床推理的潜力，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）和青光眼筛查中的应用。

Method: 使用300张标注的眼底图像，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4在ICDR分类、DR转诊和青光眼转诊任务中的表现，并分析临床元数据的影响。

Result: GPT-4在ICDR分类中表现中等（准确率67.5%），在DR转诊任务中表现较好（准确率82.3%），但在青光眼转诊中表现差（准确率约78%）。元数据对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4可从结构化提示中模拟基本眼科决策，但缺乏复杂任务的精确性，不适合临床使用，可能适用于教育或文档辅助。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因知识冲突导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据、上下文感知证据、冲突驱动总结和QA修复步骤。

Result: 在含噪声或冲突证据的场景中，CARE-RAG表现优于现有RAG基线。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG通过重新思考所有证据，显著提升了RAG系统的可信度。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Result: 在多个推理密集型基准测试中，CompactDS显著提升模型性能，相对增益达10%-33%。

Conclusion: CompactDS证明了高质量、多样化数据存储的重要性，且其性能优于复杂代理系统，同时保持简单和可复现性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种无需额外训练或基于幅值剪枝的激活稀疏化方法，通过层间正交旋转和Top-K选择，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有激活稀疏化方法存在恢复训练耗时或基于幅值剪枝导致稀疏性波动的问题，LaRoSA旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现一致的模型级稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏度下，LaRoSA仅增加0.17困惑度差距，推理速度提升1.30倍，零样本任务准确率差距缩小至0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA是一种高效且稳定的激活稀疏化方法，适用于多种LLM，显著提升推理速度且性能损失极小。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Abstract: Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult
task for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring a synthesis of profound
conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study,
we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models,
such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated
from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental
evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do
they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics
questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize
on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these
highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot
prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy,
highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SynPref-40M的大规模偏好数据集，并设计了人机协同的两阶段数据标注流程，训练出Skywork-Reward-V2奖励模型系列，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在捕捉人类偏好方面表现不佳，主要原因是偏好数据集存在范围狭窄、标签合成或质量控制不足等问题。

Method: 通过人机协同的两阶段标注流程（人类提供高质量标注，AI进行大规模自动标注），构建了包含4000万偏好对的SynPref-40M数据集，并从中精选2600万对训练了Skywork-Reward-V2系列模型。

Result: Skywork-Reward-V2在人类偏好对齐、安全性、抗风格偏见等多个能力上表现优异，在七个主要奖励模型基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究表明，数据规模和高质标注的结合是提升奖励模型性能的关键，人机协同标注流程能显著提高数据质量。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

Conclusion: 该框架为处理真实临床文本提供了高效算法基础，对多标签医学文本建模任务具有实际意义。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogitSpec是一种无需训练的检索式推测解码方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit推测后续token，显著提升LLM推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式推测解码方法难以找到匹配的准确草案token，限制了其效果。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成草案token：利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个及下下个token，并检索相关参考。

Result: 实验表明，LogitSpec可实现最高2.61倍加速，平均每解码步骤接受3.28个token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec是一种高效、易集成的推测解码方法，显著提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based ATS系统缺乏对目标群体偏好的反馈，导致个性化不足。

Method: 扩展了标准监督微调（SFT）方法，采用DPO技术，结合智力障碍人士的偏好反馈进行后训练。

Result: 研究强调了目标群体参与设计个性化AI解决方案的必要性。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化包容性AI系统迈出了一步，融合了专家和目标群体的见解。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中对未见或模糊查询的鲁棒性问题，提升OOS检测的效率和准确性。

Method: 1. 对已部署的意图分类器输出进行不确定性估计；2. 对高不确定性实例触发微调的LLM进行最终决策。

Result: 在关键OOS检测基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，包括来自实际部署系统的数据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了计算效率和性能，结合传统方法与LLM，为OOS检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented
dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous
queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that
combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for
efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

### [254] [Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01543)
*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在立场检测任务中，外部信息（如维基百科或网络搜索内容）通常降低大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，而非提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨外部信息对LLM在立场检测任务中的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 系统评估八种LLM在三个数据集上的表现，分析外部信息对其立场检测的影响。

Result: 外部信息在多数情况下降低性能，F1分数最多下降27.9%，且LLM倾向于与外部信息的立场对齐。

Conclusion: 外部信息可能引入偏见，影响LLM的立场检测性能，与BERT等模型的结论相反。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

Conclusion: 结合LLM和结构化奖励模型的任务导向对话系统更具韧性和情感智能，是未来发展的方向。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

Motivation: 随着指令调优神经语言模型的发展，NLP评估从全局评分转向成对比较，需研究两者的优劣以指导评估策略选择。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 建议根据评估需求选择方法，全局评分适合总体排名，成对比较适合特定场景如文本生成。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言中的表现，特别是不同语言类别（已见、部分见、未见）的性能差异。

Method: 使用印尼单语BERT、多语言模型（mBERT、XLM-R）和适配器方法MAD-X，评估零样本和适配器迁移性能。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言中表现最佳，部分见次之，未见最差；MAD-X显著提升性能，尤其是已见和部分见语言。

Conclusion: 模型对语言的预训练暴露程度是迁移成功的最一致预测因素，而非词汇重叠或子词分割。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

Result: 实验表明AdamMeme能系统揭示不同mLLMs的性能差异，深入分析模型弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为评估mLLMs对有害模因的理解提供了动态、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能对敏感领域造成危害，研究旨在通过联合学习提升检测性能。

Method: 使用StereoBias数据集，比较编码器模型和解码器模型（通过QLoRA微调），并进行联合训练。

Result: 联合训练显著提升偏见检测效果，且解码器模型表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息可以构建更公平有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战和机会，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，利用LLMs和上下文学习评估合同条款合法性，测试不同法律上下文对模型性能的影响。

Result: 完整法律文本略微提升性能，而精简版法律指南显著提高召回率和F1分数（80%），但LLMs表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLMs在合同合法性审查中有潜力，但仍存在局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,
and have significant implications for both quantitative and qualitative
approaches in corpus-based research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuRating是一个可扩展的多语言数据质量评估框架，通过将英语数据质量信号转移到17种目标语言，提升大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据质量评估方法主要针对英语，缺乏多语言支持，限制了模型在多语言任务中的表现。

Method: MuRating通过聚合多个英语评分器的信号，学习统一的文档质量评分，并通过翻译将这些评分投射到目标语言，训练多语言评估器。

Result: MuRating在英语和多语言评估中均显著提升模型性能，尤其在知识密集型任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: MuRating为多语言数据质量评估提供了有效解决方案，并指出了未来在翻译保真度和内容平衡方面的改进方向。

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

TL;DR: 研究发现Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct模型能区分测试与部署阶段，线性探针可分离这两种提示，表明模型内部已具备这种区分能力。安全评估被模型识别为不真实，凸显了可信评估的重要性。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在测试与部署阶段的区分能力（评估意识）及其对AI治理框架和行业承诺的潜在影响。

Method: 使用线性探针分析Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct模型，分离测试与部署提示，并评估其内部表示。

Result: 线性探针能有效区分测试与部署提示，且当前安全评估被模型视为不真实。

Conclusion: 研究强调了可信评估的必要性，并展示了如何利用模型内部信息支持黑盒安全审计，尤其是针对未来更具欺骗能力的模型。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

TL;DR: 研究多模态AI模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，发现模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，并识别出影响模态偏好的内部结构和注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态模型在输入信息冲突时的行为，探索模型如何整合和优先处理不同模态的信息。

Method: 通过向视觉-语言模型提供不一致的输入（如图像与标题矛盾），观察模型对特定模态信息的报告行为，并分析其内部结构和注意力机制。

Result: 模型倾向于优先处理某一模态，且这种偏好体现在内部表示结构中；识别出可调整模态偏好的注意力机制和模态无关的“路由头”。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型在复杂环境中的冲突信号处理提供了重要基础。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Motivation: 自动医疗编码可简化文档和计费流程，但需要透明性，而现有评估方法因数据稀缺受限。

Method: 深入分析MDACE数据集，评估现有可解释医疗编码系统的合理性，并提出匹配度量。

Result: 真实证据与代码描述部分一致，先进方法与真实证据高度重叠。

Conclusion: 研究为开发与评估可解释医疗编码系统提供了建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Motivation: 研究不同序列化格式在临床笔记中的解析性能，为隐私敏感的临床环境提供实用指导。

Method: 评估三种格式（JSON、YAML、XML）的解析性能，分析错误模式。

Result: JSON解析性能最佳，但长文档和特定笔记类型会降低稳健性。

Conclusion: 建议在临床环境中优先选择JSON，并优化提示设计以提高解析稳健性。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from
clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON,
YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability.
Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何利用训练数据对透明度、责任、隐私和公平性至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种系统方法，通过分析低困惑度序列（模型生成的高概率文本片段）来追踪训练数据来源。

Result: 发现大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练数据，并对匹配序列的分布进行了量化。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLMs训练数据如何影响其行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond English centric benchmarks and
address the requirements of linguistically diverse regions such as India. We
present EKA-EVAL, a unified and production-ready evaluation framework that
integrates over 35 benchmarks, including 10 Indic-specific datasets, spanning
categories like reasoning, mathematics, tool use, long-context understanding,
and reading comprehension. Compared to existing Indian language evaluation
tools, EKA-EVAL offers broader benchmark coverage, with built-in support for
distributed inference, quantization, and multi-GPU usage. Our systematic
comparison positions EKA-EVAL as the first end-to-end, extensible evaluation
suite tailored for both global and Indic LLMs, significantly lowering the
barrier to multilingual benchmarking. The framework is open-source and publicly
available at https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/ eka-eval and a part of ongoing EKA
initiative (https://eka.soket.ai), which aims to scale up to over 100
benchmarks and establish a robust, multilingual evaluation ecosystem for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言学习工具在多语言词汇连接、个性化学习和认知卸载方面存在不足。

Method: 设计DIY-MKG系统，利用LLM构建个性化词汇知识图谱，支持动态测验生成和用户反馈。

Result: 评估显示DIY-MKG在多语言词汇扩展和测验生成方面表现可靠且准确。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG是一个有效的多语言学习工具，解决了现有工具的局限性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

TL;DR: MiCoTA框架通过中间规模模型和中间长度推理序列，提升小语言模型的长推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型（SLMs）在长推理任务中的学习能力不足问题。

Method: 使用中间规模模型作为教师助手，利用中间长度推理序列填补能力与推理长度差距。

Result: 实验显示，MiCoTA显著提升SLMs的推理性能，如Qwen2.5-7B和3B模型在多个基准测试中平均得分提高3.47和3.93。

Conclusion: MiCoTA为SLMs的长推理数据蒸馏提供了新思路，未来研究可进一步探索。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

Motivation: 传统剪枝方法不考虑注意力头在网络中的位置，导致性能下降，因此需要一种更智能的剪枝策略。

Method: 提出了一种剪枝算法，针对高层注意力头进行剪枝，并引入自适应重缩放参数以校准表示规模。

Result: 在多个LLM模型和27个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成任务中显著优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能剪枝和重缩放，显著提升了模型性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

Result: 理论证明GAPO收敛于帕累托最优解，实验显示其在Mistral-7B上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAPO能有效平衡冲突目标，提升LLM与人类偏好的对齐性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

Motivation: 探索教师模型推理演示对学生模型推理能力提升的最有效方式。

Method: 从教师模型中精选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），分析影响推理能力蒸馏的因素。

Result: NaturalThoughts在多个推理基准测试中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: 精选困难且多样化的推理样本能更高效地提升学生模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

Motivation: 传统NLG评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与实际决策效果相关性较弱，需要更直接的评估方式。

Method: 提出决策导向的评估框架，通过市场摘要文本（客观和主观内容）测试人类和LLM的决策质量，比较其交易表现。

Result: 人类和LLM单独依赖摘要时表现不优于随机，但结合分析评论后，人机协作团队显著优于单独表现。

Conclusion: 评估生成文本应关注其促进人机协同决策的能力，传统内在指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

optimization, including learning rate, epochs, and model checkpoint selection,
we have compared the models based on Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error

Motivation: 评估LLMs在辩论中的表现及其对对话结构的理解能力。

Result: LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论，但无法理解深层对话结构。

Conclusion: LLMs的辩论能力不依赖于对内容的理解，实用性和连贯性比理解更重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

*Zeyi Liu,Shuang Li,Eric Cousineau,Siyuan Feng,Benjamin Burchfiel,Shuran Song*

TL;DR: 提出了一种4D视频生成模型，通过跨视角点图对齐监督，实现多视角3D一致性，提升机器人对动态场景的理解和预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强机器人在复杂环境中规划和交互的能力，解决现有视频生成模型在时间连贯性和几何一致性上的不足。

Method: 利用RGB-D观测数据，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练模型，学习共享的3D场景表示，无需相机姿态输入。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上，生成更稳定且空间对齐的视频预测，并能恢复机器人末端执行器轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法支持机器人操作和适应新视角，为动态场景建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Result: cp_measure特征与CellProfiler特征高度一致，并能无缝集成到科学Python生态系统中。

Conclusion: cp_measure支持可重复、自动化的图像分析流程，适用于计算生物学中的机器学习应用。

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific
visual properties of interest for cells or other entities. A complementary
paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

Motivation: 解决现有SOD模型在资源受限设备上计算成本高的问题，实现实时性能。

Method: 提出SDNet和STDNet，分别用于图像和视频SOD，结合PDCs和DCR策略，以及时空差异卷积（STDC）。

Result: 模型在Jetson Orin设备上以46 FPS（图像）和150 FPS（视频）运行，参数少于1M，速度和准确性均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和准确性之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限的实时应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Motivation: 多模态MRI在脑肿瘤分割中提供互补信息，但传统方法在模态缺失时表现不佳，需解决这一问题。

Method: 采用单模态并行处理框架，结合Holder散度和互信息设计损失函数，动态调整网络参数以适应输入模态。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和2020数据集上，优于现有方法，尤其在模态缺失情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升分割准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

Result: 在评分相关性和评论质量上达到最优，视频生成质量提升53.5%。

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面、人类对齐的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究和杂草管理系统的开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

Motivation: 现有基于对比学习的方法引入雾无关内容且忽略雾在频域的特性（如振幅谱中的退化），需改进。

Method: 提出频域扩散模型，利用振幅残差编码器（ARE）补偿振幅差距，相位校正模块（PCM）消除伪影。

Result: 实验表明，\ours 在合成和真实数据集上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 频域扩散模型结合ARE和PCM有效解决了无配对去雾问题。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ET-Fuser是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，能够统一特征表示并提升任务性能。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过将任务重新定义为铬球修复问题，从单张低动态范围（LDR）图像估计光照的简单有效技术。利用预训练的扩散模型Stable Diffusion XL，解决了依赖有限HDR全景数据集方法的泛化问题。通过迭代修复生成稳定的低频光照先验，并结合曝光LoRA生成HDR光探针。进一步提出DiffusionLight-Turbo，将运行时间从30分钟缩短至30秒。

Conclusion: DiffusionLight和DiffusionLight-Turbo在光照估计任务中表现出色，后者显著提升了效率，同时保持了高质量结果。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非准确中性校正，且现有学习型方法难以跨相机传感器泛化。本文首次解决美学一致性问题。

Method: 提出一种后光照估计映射，将中性白平衡转换为相机无关空间的美学偏好校正，模型仅含约500参数，计算高效。

Result: 在771张智能手机图像数据集上表现优异，计算时间仅0.024毫秒，兼容现有跨相机AWB技术。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，实现了跨相机美学一致性，且计算和内存开销极小。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Result: GTTA在多种任务和数据集上表现优异，验证了其通用性和有效性，尤其在低能见度水下视频中的三文鱼分割任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种通用且高效的测试时增强方法，显著提升了模型性能，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Result: 实验验证了LTDR在多个基准测试中的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR为视觉语言MoE框架提供了更优的路由策略，提升了性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验验证了PGA的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PGA框架显著提升了物理对抗攻击的跨视角鲁棒性和对抗效果。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Activation RMs的新方法，通过激活导向构建奖励信号，无需额外微调，显著优于现有少样本奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好且依赖大规模数据集的问题。

Method: 利用激活导向构建奖励信号，仅需少量监督数据且无需额外模型微调。

Result: 在标准奖励建模基准和PreferenceHack基准上表现优异，超越现有方法及GPT-4o。

Conclusion: Activation RMs为少样本奖励建模提供了高效且安全的解决方案，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的工作流程缺乏足够的准确性和统计保证，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合AI预测和人类标注，采用重要性采样和蒙特卡洛估计逐步优化模型和测量结果。

Result: 主动测量在多个测量任务中降低了估计误差，且能在AI模型不完美时仍提供精确估计。

Conclusion: 主动测量是一种高效且可靠的科学测量方法，尤其适用于需要高精度和低人工成本的任务。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪标签增强的音频-视觉Mamba网络（MUG），用于改进弱监督音频-视觉视频解析任务中的段级和事件级预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并采用音频-视觉Mamba网络进行特征处理和交互。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和Mamba网络，显著提升了音频-视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Conclusion: FixTalk为高质量说话头生成提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以精细控制生成描述的属性，且无法平滑切换语言模式。

Method: 量化描述属性为连续标量值，通过端点向量插值实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整输出描述属性，词汇对齐优于基线，长度控制误差降低506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths成功实现单模型处理多样化语言模式，提升控制精度和词汇对齐。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度来提升检测效果，同时保持ID分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中部署深度学习模型时，OOD检测至关重要。研究发现ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本的梯度方向混乱，这启发了新方法的提出。

Method: 提出了一种推理阶段的技术，短路异常梯度，并通过一阶近似避免重复计算。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且易于集成。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion在文档图像阴影去除任务中表现优异，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: DiffMark通过扩散模型和对抗性指导，显著提升了水印的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，速度提升显著（如3DMatch+FCGF上快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg在保持高召回率的同时大幅提升效率，适用于实时PCR任务。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略显著提升了异常分割性能，并可作为插件兼容其他模型。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NOCTIS通过结合先进模型和优化匹配策略，实现了高效且泛化的实例分割。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

Method: 提出REG方法，将低层图像潜在变量与预训练基础模型的单个高层类别标记纠缠，实现从纯噪声中生成一致的图像-类别对。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，SiT-XL/2 + REG实现了63倍和23倍于SiT-XL/2和SiT-XL/2 + REPA的训练加速，且仅需400K次迭代即可超越4M次迭代的REPA模型。

Conclusion: REG方法通过语义知识的主动引导，显著提升了生成质量和训练效率，且推理开销极小。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效、低功耗的甲烷泄漏检测算法，包括Mag1c-SAS和CEM，并结合机器学习模型，显著提升了检测速度和硬件适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是一种强效温室气体，通过高光谱卫星图像早期检测其泄漏有助于减缓气候变化。现有方法计算量大，难以在资源有限的机载硬件上实现。

Method: 测试了快速目标检测方法（ACE、CEM），提出了Mag1c-SAS算法，并结合机器学习模型（U-Net、LinkNet）进行检测。还提出了三种波段选择策略。

Result: Mag1c-SAS和CEM在检测强羽流时表现良好，计算效率分别比原始Mag1c快约100倍和230倍。其中一种波段选择策略在减少通道数的同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为机载甲烷检测提供了高效、低硬件需求的解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Conclusion: AVC-DPO通过偏好对齐显著提升了视频MLLMs的标题生成能力。

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ReFlow在图像质量和文本对齐上优于扩散模型，但实际图像编辑仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用中间潜在表示提取关键特征，调整注意力机制以提升编辑性和目标文本对齐。

Result: 在两个基准测试中优于九种基线方法，人类评估显示用户偏好该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练或掩码，适用于无源提示的情况，性能优越。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably

Motivation: 息肉分割在结肠镜图像中对早期结直肠癌检测至关重要，但现有方法在弱边界和模糊边界情况下表现不佳，且泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合边界蒸馏模块和1D-2D Mamba适配器，增强全局上下文交互和边界特征学习。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新性的边界先验和1D-2D Mamba模块，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing

performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,

problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖判别式学习，擅长低频特征但忽视高频边界细节，扩散生成模型擅长高频细节但低频语义推断不足。

Method: IDGBR框架先用判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过条件引导网络和扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上验证了IDGBR能一致优化不同判别式架构的粗分割结果。

Conclusion: IDGBR有效结合判别式和生成式学习，显著提升边界分割精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

Motivation: 传统2D动画着色过程劳动密集，需要手工绘制和着色大量帧，因此需要一种高效且高质量的自动化方法。

Method: 采用扩散变压器（DiT）架构，替换传统U-Net去噪器，通过轻量级通道连接适配器和LoRA微调注入草图信息，减少参数和内存占用。

Result: 在SAKUGA数据集上，SketchColour在所有指标上优于现有视频着色方法，仅使用一半训练数据，生成时间一致且无显著伪影的动画。

Conclusion: SketchColour提供了一种高效、高质量的2D动画着色解决方案，显著减少人工劳动和计算资源需求。

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number

the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied

Method: 将ISO、快门速度和光圈值转换为向量，用于控制和增强去噪网络的性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法为标准去噪神经网络增加了可控性并提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了基于相机参数的自适应去噪，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: DepthSync提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过扩散引导实现长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度不一致和几何预测不准确的问题，主要依赖2D扩散先验而忽略了3D几何结构。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，协同优化去噪过程，确保跨窗口的尺度同步和窗口内的几何对齐。

Result: 实验表明，DepthSync在多个数据集上显著提升了长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DepthSync为长视频深度估计提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Method: 通过探索深度学习人脸识别系统的后门攻击可行性，提出了两种新型攻击（人脸生成和面部标志点偏移攻击），并验证了其在20种系统配置和15种攻击案例中的有效性。

Result: 研究表明，单一后门攻击可绕过整个系统功能，且基于大间隔损失训练的特征提取器同样易受攻击。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了深度学习人脸识别系统的后门攻击风险，并提出了防护措施，为相关利益方提供了实践指导。

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

TL;DR: POLC提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法，通过丰富潜在特征的语义内容，提升了压缩域语义推理的性能，同时减少了微调的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型在潜在空间中语义丰富性不足，且需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了压缩域语义推理的效果。

Method: 提出POLC方法，通过优化潜在特征的语义内容，仅需一个即插即用的适配器进行微调，显著减少参数数量。

Result: 实验表明，POLC在率感知性能上与生成式图像编码方法相当，同时显著提升了视觉任务性能，且微调开销极小。

Conclusion: POLC通过语义丰富的潜在空间和轻量级微调机制，为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is
available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/POLC.

TL;DR: P3HOT框架通过结合提示引导和人类近端感知，改进HOT检测任务，解决了现有模型在区域分割和类别一致性上的问题，并在多个指标上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过多分割和类别一致性差，亟需改进。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动的提示机制和人类近端感知机制，引入区域联合损失（RJLoss）和新评估指标AD-Acc。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU和AD-Acc.指标分别提升0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0。

Conclusion: P3HOT在HOT检测任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种扩展到大场景的NeRF框架，通过分块处理和重叠裁剪图像，解决了内存限制问题，并在单GPU上实现线性时间复杂度的处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，无法处理大规模卫星图像。

Method: 将感兴趣区域划分为无重叠的3D块，采用2×2 3D块渐进策略和分段采样器，避免边缘重建错误。

Result: 实验表明，Snake-NeRF能在单GPU上高效处理大规模卫星图像，且不牺牲质量。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF为大规模3D重建提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础单目深度估计模型在复杂环境（如光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真）中表现不佳，且缺乏高质量伪标签生成能力。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验表明，DepthAnything-AC在多种基准测试（包括恶劣天气、合成失真和通用场景）中具备零样本能力。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过创新方法解决了复杂环境下的深度估计问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的ViT在图像-文本对比学习或自监督机制中表现优异，但在与LLM直接联合训练时存在参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距问题，限制了多模态交互的性能。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过逐步特征细化实现从粗到细的特征对齐和世界知识注入，适应目标训练需求。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的挑战，为多模态大语言模型的性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，计算复杂且内存开销大，而线性注意力机制在图像生成中因无法捕捉长距离依赖导致质量下降。

Method: 提出LASAD机制，通过基于真实2D空间位置的位置相关衰减因子保留空间关系，构建LASADGen模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成质量和计算效率上达到最优。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的效率与高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Method: 提出扩散模拟管线生成合成数据，设计稳健特征编码器结合ConvNet和去噪Transformer。

Result: 实验表明RobuSTereo显著提升模型在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo有效解决了数据稀缺和特征提取问题，提升了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的性能。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

Motivation: 标准tokenization方法将特征限制在离散的patch网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景下的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，结合oracle-guided搜索，实现token在图像中的连续定位。

Result: 通过理想子像素定位，显著提升性能并减少推理所需的token数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效且可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为战略优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习在图像目标导航中可行，但需注意模拟器设置的影响，且部分能力可迁移。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了其有效性，尤其在利用空间局部信息方面表现突出。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应机制和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景下的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小波去噪方法在提取传感器模式噪声（SPN）时需要反演步骤，效率较低。本文旨在优化这一过程。

Method: 将指纹构建为小波域指纹，直接在频域进行比较，避免了反演步骤。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅检测精度更高，还能显著提升处理速度。

Conclusion: 小波域指纹提取方法在效率和准确性上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Motivation: 解决硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性和错误的问题，提出软自标记方法。

Result: 软自标记显著提升了基于涂鸦的训练效果，性能优于复杂系统和全监督方法。

Conclusion: 软自标记方法在弱监督分割中表现优异，适用于其他弱监督问题。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Conclusion: 剪枝与视觉模型的可解释性、表示学习和人类对齐之间存在复杂关系，需进一步研究剪枝何时及如何有益于视觉表示。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HOI-Dyn的新框架，通过驱动-响应系统生成逼真的3D人-物交互（HOI），解决了现有方法独立处理人和物体运动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立处理人和物体运动，导致物理上不合理且因果不一致的行为，因此需要一种新方法来建模详细的交互动态。

Method: HOI-Dyn框架将HOI生成建模为驱动-响应系统，使用轻量级基于Transformer的交互动态模型预测物体对人物运动的响应，并通过残差动态损失增强一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅提升了HOI生成的质量，还提供了评估生成交互质量的可行指标。

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn框架有效解决了3D人-物交互生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有RIS框架缺乏对性能瓶颈的系统分析，尤其是多模态认知能力的不足。

Method: 提出DeRIS框架，分解RIS为感知和认知模块，采用Loopback Synergy机制增强模块协同，并引入非参考样本转换数据增强。

Result: DeRIS在精确分割和图像-文本理解方面表现优异，且无需专门架构修改即可适应多场景。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化分析和协同机制，有效解决了RIS的主要瓶颈，提升了通用性和性能。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Vision Transformers (ViTs) 和掩码自编码器 (MAE) 的3D医学图像分割方法，首次将其应用于颅内动脉钙化 (IAC) 分割，并在临床数据上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中表现不佳，但其自监督训练特性使其适合处理无需昂贵标注的大规模医学影像数据。IAC作为神经血管疾病的生物标志物，自动化量化有助于大规模风险评估。

Method: 采用MAE框架预训练ViTs，并在IST-3临床试验的异构数据上微调用于IAC分割。研究了低patch大小和插值上采样对ViTs性能的影响。

Result: 1) 自监督ViT比监督nnU-Net基线高3.2 Dice分数；2) 低patch大小和插值上采样对ViTs更优；3) ViTs提高了对高切片厚度的鲁棒性，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: MAE预训练的ViTs在IAC分割中表现优异，为医学图像分析提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉变换器（ViT）在医学图像分类中的表示缺乏语义意义，且对微小变化敏感，导致分类结果不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉变换器在医学图像任务中的表示是否具有语义意义及其稳定性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析ViT的表示。

Result: ViT的表示对微小变化敏感，语义意义不足，分类准确率可下降60%以上。

Conclusion: ViT在医学图像分类中的表示存在根本性问题，影响其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量流失加剧，需精确监测崩解前沿以理解崩解过程，现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出自监督多模态预训练技术（利用新数据集SSL4SAR）和混合模型架构（Swin Transformer编码器+残差CNN解码器）。

Result: 模型在CaFFe基准数据集上平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差75米，接近人类水平（38米）。

Conclusion: 该技术能精确监测冰川崩解前沿的季节性变化，为冰川研究提供重要工具。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

Motivation: 解决自回归视觉生成模型中量化过程导致的信息损失问题，同时避免连续标记建模的挑战。

Method: 提出DisCon框架，将离散标记作为条件信号，建模连续表示的条件概率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上，DisCon的gFID得分为1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优点，显著提升了图像生成性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提升了攻击成功率，平均提高2.3%至32.6%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SGP作为一种可扩展的输入变换方法，易于集成到现有攻击中，有效增强对抗样本的可迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA为多主题个性化提供了一种简单高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督解决了现有方法的不足，提升了3D VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

Result: 在nuScenes和ETH/UCY数据集上，AMD在长尾轨迹预测和整体预测精度上均表现最优。

Conclusion: AMD框架显著提升了模型对长尾轨迹的识别能力，并适应数据分布变化。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤镜结合消费级硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per
second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best
trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态时序槽变换器（DTST）模块，用于解决手术视频中对象中心表示学习的挑战，并在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的异构场景（如手术视频）难以解析为有意义的一组槽，现有方法在手术视频上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了动态时序槽变换器（DTST）模块，结合时序推理和预测未来最优槽初始化。

Result: 模型在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于现实世界数据，并成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 论文评估了多模态基础模型在标准计算机视觉任务上的表现，发现它们虽不及专业模型，但作为通用模型表现尚可，且在语义任务上优于几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态基础模型在视觉理解方面的实际能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过提示链将标准视觉任务转化为文本可提示和API兼容的任务，建立标准化评估框架。

Result: 模型在语义任务上表现较好，但不及专业模型；GPT-4o在非推理模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPRED的框架，用于解决半监督终身行人重识别（Semi-LReID）问题，通过动态原型和双知识协作提升未标记数据的利用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中标注资源有限，现有方法在未标记数据利用时性能下降严重，需要一种能长期适应噪声数据的解决方案。

Method: 引入可学习的身份原型动态生成高质量伪标签，并通过双知识协作（当前模型和历史模型）净化噪声伪标签。

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，有效提升了未标记数据的利用和长期学习性能。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) 通过灵活的自回归建模和局部感知生成顺序，显著加速自回归图像生成，减少生成步骤并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成依赖顺序预测，导致高延迟。现有方法尝试多块预测并行化，但效果有限。LPD旨在实现高并行化同时保持生成质量。

Method: 1. 灵活并行自回归建模：支持任意生成顺序和并行度，利用可学习位置查询令牌确保并行解码一致性。2. 局部感知生成顺序：通过分组最小化组内依赖，最大化上下文支持。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成中，将生成步骤从256降至20（256×256分辨率）和1024降至48（512×512分辨率），延迟降低至少3.4倍。

Conclusion: LPD通过新颖的架构和调度策略，显著提升了自回归图像生成的效率和性能。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理需要深度推理的复杂假设性指令，且缺乏支持训练和评估的数据集和架构。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型和细粒度推理线索提取模块。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优于现有方法，并具备零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间准确性指标，但手动标记对于高度移动的GI器官具有挑战性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道生成21个运动阶段的4D序列，模拟GI运动，并使用六种DIR方法进行评估。

Result: DT模型成功模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度与真实患者数据相似，并提供了详细的DIR性能指标。

Conclusion: 该管道能够严格测试DIR工具在动态复杂区域的性能，为空间和剂量准确性提供了详细验证。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种信息融合框架，结合多季节结构数据，支持果园自动化管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，茂密树冠遮挡结构，影响机器视觉系统性能，而休眠季节结构更清晰。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg在休眠季节数据集的MSE为0.0047，mAP@50为0.78；Kinect Fusion重建误差小；Fast GICP配准精度高。

Conclusion: 多季节融合框架提高了机器人系统对树冠结构的理解，优化了果园自动化操作。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom是一个统一的图像定制框架，通过上下文学习整合位置感知和无位置定制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用DiT的多模态注意力机制和ICMA机制处理不同任务类型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅训练0.4%的模型参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

Motivation: 探索多层感知机（MLPs）在视觉任务中的应用，并通过事件驱动机制减少冗余计算，提高计算效率。

Method: 提出evMLP，利用事件驱动机制选择性处理图像或特征图中的变化区域（事件），避免对未变化区域进行冗余计算。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中表现优异，同时在视频数据集上显著降低计算成本，保持输出一致性。

Conclusion: evMLP通过事件驱动机制实现了高效计算，为视觉模型架构提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Conclusion: CI-VID数据集为故事驱动内容的生成提供了高质量支持，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

Conclusion: LongAnimation框架通过动态全局-局部范式成功解决了长期颜色一致性问题，为动画产业提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Conclusion: Kwai Keye-VL成功提升了短视频理解能力，并通过新基准KC-MMBench验证了其优势。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

Motivation: 增强机器人在复杂环境中规划和交互的能力，解决现有视频生成模型在时间连贯性和几何一致性上的不足。

Method: 利用RGB-D观测数据，通过跨视角点图对齐监督训练模型，学习共享3D场景表示，无需相机姿态输入。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上生成更稳定、空间对齐的视频预测，支持机器人末端执行器轨迹恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法在机器人操作和新视角泛化方面表现出色，为动态场景建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational

Motivation: 解决现有深度神经网络在显著目标检测中计算成本高的问题，实现在资源受限设备上的高效部署。

Method: 结合传统SOD的对比线索与现代CNN，使用PDCs编码特征对比，并通过DCR策略嵌入标准卷积以减少计算量。针对视频SOD，引入时空差异卷积（STDC）。

Result: 模型SDNet和STDNet在Jetson Orin设备上分别以46 FPS和150 FPS运行，参数少于1M，速度和准确性均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和准确性之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备的实时SOD任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Motivation: 多模态MRI数据常因图像质量、协议不一致、患者过敏或经济限制而缺失某些模态，传统方法难以应对，需开发鲁棒的分割方法。

Method: 采用单模态并行处理框架，结合Holder散度和互信息设计损失函数，动态调整网络参数以适应输入模态的变化。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效应对多模态MRI数据缺失问题，提升分割准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

Conclusion: AIGVE-MACS为AI生成视频评估提供了全面、人类对齐的新范式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

Conclusion: DiffusionLight及其加速版本DiffusionLight-Turbo提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的光照估计方法，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非中性色彩校正，且现有学习型方法难以泛化到不同相机传感器。本文旨在解决美学一致性问题。

Method: 通过学习一个后照明估计映射，将中性白平衡校正转换为美学偏好校正，并在相机无关空间中实现。模型仅含约500参数，计算高效。

Result: 在771张来自三种不同智能手机相机的图像数据集上，该方法实现了最先进的性能，计算时间仅为0.024毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，兼容现有跨相机AWB技术，显著提升了美学一致性且计算开销极小。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Conclusion: GTTA是一种高效且通用的测试时增强方法，显著提升了模型性能且不增加计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态感知路由和专家激活增强，显著提升了视觉-语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的少样本奖励建模方法Activation RMs，通过激活导向构建对齐的奖励信号，无需额外微调，并在标准基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励建模难以适应新偏好，需独立奖励模型和大规模偏好数据集，限制了灵活性。

Method: 利用激活导向技术构建奖励信号，仅需少量监督数据，无需额外模型微调。

Result: Activation RMs在标准基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并在新提出的PreferenceHack基准中取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: Activation RMs为少样本奖励建模提供了高效且安全的解决方案，适用于关键安全应用。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“主动测量”的人机协作AI框架，用于科学测量，通过重要性采样和迭代优化模型，减少估计误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在科学发现中的工作流程缺乏足够的准确性和统计保证，需要一种更高效且可靠的方法。

Method: 使用AI模型预测测量值，通过重要性采样选择样本进行人工标注，迭代优化模型并生成无偏估计。

Result: 主动测量能在AI模型不完美时提供精确估计，并在模型准确时减少人工工作量，显著降低估计误差。

Conclusion: 主动测量是一种高效且可靠的科学测量方法，适用于多种测量任务。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪标签增强的音频-视觉Mamba网络（MUG），用于弱监督音频-视觉视频解析，提升了段级和事件级预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构的限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测的性能。

Method: 使用伪标签增强数据，通过跨模态随机组合生成新数据，并采用音频-视觉Mamba网络进行特征处理和交互。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和AV-Mamba网络，显著提升了弱监督音频-视觉视频解析的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明FixTalk有效减少了身份泄漏和伪影，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FixTalk为高质量说话头生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的建模方案有效提升了车道和道路边界的预测性能。

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly
available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture,
which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and
denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance.
Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous
methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

Motivation: 胎儿腹部畸形是严重的先天性异常，需要准确诊断以指导妊娠管理并降低死亡率。AI在医学诊断中潜力巨大，但在产前腹部异常领域的应用仍有限。现有研究多关注图像级分类，而较少关注病例级诊断。

Method: 提出了一种基于MIL的方法，包括MoAE模块（加权不同注意力头）、MFS模块（医学知识驱动的特征选择）和PPL模块（提示原型学习）。

Conclusion: 该方法在病例级诊断中表现出色，为产前腹部异常的AI辅助诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

TL;DR: 提出CaptionSmiths方法，通过量化标题属性并插值端点向量，实现标题语言模式的灵活控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标题生成模型难以精细控制标题属性，如长度和描述性。

Method: 量化标题长度、描述性和词汇独特性，通过插值端点向量实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整标题属性，词汇对齐优于基线，长度控制误差减少506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths为标题生成提供了灵活且高效的控制方法。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向一致性的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度方向来提升检测性能，同时保持ID分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，OOD检测对深度学习模型的安全部署至关重要。研究发现，ID样本的梯度方向一致，而OOD样本的梯度方向混乱，这为检测提供了新思路。

Method: 提出一种推理阶段技术，短路异常梯度方向，同时引入局部一阶近似以避免重复计算。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且易于集成。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的OOD检测提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Conclusion: DocShaDiffusion通过潜在空间建模和掩模引导，有效解决了颜色阴影问题，同时保留了文档细节和结构。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: DiffMark为对抗Deepfake提供了一种鲁棒水印解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上达到最优性能，速度提升显著（如3DMatch+FCGF数据集上比3DMAC快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg在速度和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，OoDDINO优于现有方法，兼容性强。

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略显著提升异常分割精度，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NOCTIS通过简单但强大的框架，显著提升了未见物体实例分割的性能，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效、低功耗的甲烷泄漏检测方法，通过改进现有算法和结合机器学习，实现了在资源有限的星载硬件上的快速检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是一种强效温室气体，早期检测其泄漏对缓解气候变化至关重要。现有方法计算量大，难以在星载硬件上实时运行。

Method: 测试了快速目标检测方法（ACE、CEM），并提出改进算法Mag1c-SAS，结合机器学习模型（U-Net、LinkNet）进行验证。

Result: Mag1c-SAS和CEM在检测强羽流时表现良好，计算效率分别比原Mag1c快100倍和230倍。还提出了三种波段选择策略，其中一种在减少通道数的同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为星载甲烷检测提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,
and models are open-sourced and can be accessed from

Abstract: Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial
contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal
objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments,
due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue,
we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points.
The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization
actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization
variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to
improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both
dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for
real-time tracking of industrial metal objects. Our source code is made

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

Abstract: Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved
substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to
adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To
address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct
Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to
enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment.
Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal
dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when
watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO
leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied
prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment.
Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the
LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving
first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the

Result: 在两个基准测试中优于九种基线方法，人类评估也显示用户偏好该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练和掩码的情况下，显著提升了ReFlow的实际图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

Conclusion: 规则化方法有效提升了树冠检测的准确性和鲁棒性，为森林监测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP为息肉分割领域设定了新标准，具有显著的临床潜力。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,

problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合判别式学习和扩散生成学习的框架（IDGBR），用于提升遥感图像语义分割中边界的高频特征学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长低频特征但忽略高频边界细节。扩散生成模型擅长高频细节生成，但语义推理能力不足。

Method: 结合判别式和生成式学习，先用判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上验证了IDGBR框架对边界细化的有效性。

Conclusion: IDGBR框架成功整合了两种学习的优势，显著提升了边界分割的精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing
models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal
artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available

Result: 实验表明，该方法能无缝地为标准去噪神经网络增加可控性，并提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为图像去噪提供了更灵活和高效的控制方式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive
performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising
strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In
this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to
control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental
results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthSync提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过扩散引导实现长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度不一致和几何不一致的问题，主要原因是依赖2D扩散先验而忽略了3D几何结构。

Method: 引入尺度引导和几何引导，分别同步窗口间的深度尺度和窗口内的几何对齐，协同优化去噪过程。

Result: 实验验证了DepthSync在多个数据集上能显著提升长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DepthSync通过结合尺度和几何引导，有效解决了长视频深度估计中的一致性问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Result: 研究表明，单一后门攻击可绕过整个系统功能，验证了攻击的广泛影响。

Conclusion: 论文为相关方提供了最佳实践和防御措施，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

TL;DR: POLC提出了一种感知导向的潜在编码方法，解决了传统MSE优化方法在语义丰富性和计算开销上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型在潜在空间语义丰富性上表现不足，且下游任务需要大量计算资源进行微调。

Method: 提出POLC方法，通过增强潜在特征的语义内容，仅需轻量级适配器即可实现高性能语义推理。

Result: POLC在保持与生成式图像编码方法相当的率失真性能的同时，显著提升了视觉任务性能，且微调开销极低。

Conclusion: POLC为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效且语义丰富的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is
available at https://github.com/NJUVISION/POLC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为P3HOT的框架，结合提示引导和人类近端感知，用于改进人-物接触（HOT）检测任务，解决了现有模型在分割和类别一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和类别一致性差，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动提示和人类近端感知机制，动态感知关键深度范围，并使用新的Regional Joint Loss和评价指标AD-Acc。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，模型在四个指标上均取得显著提升（SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU、AD-Acc.）。

Conclusion: P3HOT框架通过结合提示和深度感知，显著提升了HOT检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种扩展到大场景的NeRF框架，通过分块处理和优化策略，解决了内存限制问题，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制仅适用于小场景，无法处理大尺度卫星图像。

Method: 提出Snake-NeRF框架，采用分块处理、图像裁剪和3D瓦片策略，避免内存过载。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能线性处理大卫星图像，单GPU运行且质量无损。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功扩展了NeRF的应用范围，适用于大场景3D重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在一般场景中表现优异，但在复杂开放世界环境中（如光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真）表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以明确学习补丁级相对关系。

Result: 实验证明DepthAnything-AC在多样化基准测试中具有零样本能力，包括真实世界恶劣天气基准、合成失真基准和一般基准。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC通过新方法解决了复杂环境下的深度估计问题，表现出色。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有ViT通过图像-文本对比学习或自监督机制表现优异，但难以与LLM直接联合训练，存在参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距问题。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过逐步特征细化实现粗到细的特征对齐和世界知识注入，适应目标训练需求。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的挑战，为MLLM在多模态任务中的性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，存在计算复杂度和内存开销高的问题，而线性注意力机制在图像生成中表现不佳，无法捕捉长距离依赖关系。

Method: 提出了Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD)，通过基于真实2D空间位置计算衰减因子来保留空间关系，并开发了LASADGen模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成质量和计算效率上达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功弥补了线性注意力效率与高质量图像生成所需空间理解之间的差距。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下表现不佳，主要因训练数据稀缺和特征提取困难。

Method: 1. 提出扩散模拟管道生成高质量合成数据；2. 设计结合ConvNet和去噪Transformer的鲁棒特征编码器。

Result: 实验表明RobuSTereo显著提升模型在多种恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征优化，有效解决了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的挑战。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，阻碍了模型在稀疏场景下的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续标记放置和Oracle引导搜索优化标记位置。

Result: SPoT显著提升了性能，减少了推理时所需的标记数量。

Conclusion: SPoT为灵活、高效且可解释的ViT架构提供了新方向，将稀疏性转化为优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Motivation: 验证端到端强化学习是否能高效解决图像目标导航任务，并探索其潜在影响。

Result: 发现模拟器设置会影响性能，但部分能力可迁移到更现实的场景；导航性能与相对姿态估计性能相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习在图像目标导航中有效，但需注意模拟器设置的影响。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了强大、可扩展且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

*Mingfu Yan,Jiancheng Huang,Yifan Liu,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaGCD是一种基于自适应槽注意力的聚类对比学习框架，用于解决部分标记数据集中已知和未知类别的图像分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要预定义类别数量，限制了处理真实世界数据的能力。AdaGCD通过动态确定槽数量，解决了这一问题。

Method: AdaGCD结合自适应槽注意力（AdaSlot），动态分配表示容量，灵活聚类未标记数据。

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，特别是在利用空间局部信息进行类别发现方面。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应机制和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景下的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小波去噪方法需要图像重建步骤，改进方法旨在简化流程并提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，改进方法在检测精度和处理速度上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 小波域指纹提取方法更高效，适用于实际图像取证任务。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

### [428] [Soft Self-labeling and Potts Relaxations for Weakly-Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01721)
*Zhongwen Zhang,Yuri Boykov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于软自标记的弱监督分割方法，通过优化CRF/Potts损失的松弛形式，改进了网络训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性或错误，因此提出软自标记以改进弱监督分割。

Method: 提出了一种辅助损失函数，系统评估了标准和新CRF松弛、邻域系统及网络预测与软伪标签的连接方式，并提出了一种通用的连续子问题求解器。

Result: 软自标记显著改进了基于涂鸦的训练效果，性能优于更复杂的专用弱监督分割系统，甚至优于全像素级监督。

Conclusion: 软自标记是一种有效的弱监督分割方法，其思想可推广到其他弱监督问题或系统。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了剪枝对视觉模型在可解释性、无监督目标发现和人类感知对齐三个维度的影响，发现稀疏模型在某些情况下表现更优，但效果高度依赖网络架构和参数规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪枝虽能降低深度学习模型的复杂度，但其对可解释性和表示学习的影响尚不明确，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 分析不同视觉网络架构在不同稀疏度下对特征归因可解释性方法的影响，并探索剪枝是否促进更简洁的结构化表示，以及是否增强模型与人类感知的对齐。

Result: 研究发现稀疏模型在某些情况下表现出更高的可解释性、下游泛化能力和人类对齐性，但这些效果高度依赖网络架构和参数规模。

Conclusion: 剪枝对视觉表示的影响复杂，需进一步研究其适用条件和方式。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

TL;DR: HOI-Dyn框架通过驱动-响应系统生成逼真的3D人-物交互，利用轻量级Transformer模型预测物体对人物动作的反应，并通过动态损失优化一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立处理人物和物体运动，导致交互行为物理上不合理且因果不一致。

Method: 提出HOI-Dyn框架，将交互生成建模为驱动-响应系统，使用Transformer模型预测物体响应，并引入动态损失优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了交互生成质量，并提供了可行的评估指标。

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn框架在生成逼真3D人-物交互方面表现出色，同时保持了推理效率。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

TL;DR: DeRIS框架将Referring Image Segmentation（RIS）分解为感知和认知两个模块，通过Loopback Synergy机制提升多模态认知能力，并引入数据增强解决长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS框架缺乏对性能瓶颈的系统分析，尤其是多模态认知能力的不足。

Method: 提出DeRIS框架，分解RIS为感知和认知模块，引入Loopback Synergy机制和数据增强方法。

Result: DeRIS在非和多目标场景中表现优异，无需专门架构调整。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化分析和机制改进，显著提升了RIS的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

*Benjamin Jin,Grant Mair,Joanna M. Wardlaw,Maria del C. Valdés Hernández*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于MAE预训练的ViT在3D医学图像分割中的应用，特别是在颅内动脉钙化（IAC）分割任务中，表现优于传统监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中潜力巨大，但应用较少。IAC作为神经血管疾病的生物标志物，其自动化量化有助于大规模风险评估。

Method: 使用MAE框架预训练ViT，并在IST-3临床试验数据上微调用于IAC分割。探讨了低patch大小和插值上采样的重要性。

Result: 自监督ViT在Dice分数上比监督nnU-Net基线高3.2分，对高切片厚度更鲁棒，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: MAE预训练的ViT在IAC分割中表现优异，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available
online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉变换器（ViT）在医学图像分类中的表征缺乏语义意义，且对微小变化敏感，导致分类结果不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViT在医学图像任务中的表征是否具有语义意义及其稳定性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析ViT的表征。

Result: ViT的表征对微小变化敏感，分类准确率可降低60%以上。

Conclusion: ViT在医学图像分类中的表征存在根本性缺陷，影响其在安全关键系统中的部署。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术和一种混合模型架构，用于从合成孔径雷达图像中提取冰川崩解前沿位置，显著提升了监测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量损失加剧，需要更准确的全年监测方法，尤其是崩解过程的驱动因素。现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术，使用新数据集SSL4SAR，并设计混合模型架构（Swin Transformer编码器+残差CNN解码器）。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上，模型平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差降至75米，接近人类水平的38米。

Conclusion: 新技术显著提升了冰川崩解前沿的季节性变化监测精度。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

Motivation: 解决基于自回归的视觉生成模型中量化过程导致的信息损失问题，以及连续标记建模的挑战。

Method: 提出DisCon框架，将离散标记作为条件信号，建模连续表示的条件概率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务上，DisCon的gFID得分为1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon通过结合离散和连续表示的优势，显著提升了图像生成的保真度和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

Motivation: 对抗样本的迁移性对深度神经网络构成安全威胁，现有方法通常仅关注单尺度图像，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 采用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均值以确定对抗扰动。

Result: 实验表明，SGP显著提高了攻击成功率，平均提升2.3%至32.6%。

Conclusion: SGP是一种可扩展的输入变换方法，易于集成到现有攻击中，有效增强对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

TL;DR: FreeLoRA提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过融合多个特定主题的LoRA模块实现多主题个性化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化中表现不佳，需要复杂的调整或联合优化。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA提供了一种简单且通用的方法，解决了多主题个性化中的挑战。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督方法解决了现有3D VQA模型的不足，提升了模型的推理能力和性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

Result: 在nuScenes和ETH/UCY数据集上，AMD在长尾轨迹预测和整体预测准确性上均表现最优。

Conclusion: AMD框架显著提升了长尾轨迹预测能力，同时保持了整体预测的高准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤波结合消费级硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with around 4K parameters. Our
approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization
strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per
second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best
trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will
be available at https://github.com/AVC2-UESTC/MobileIE.git.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态时序槽变换器（DTST）模块，用于解决手术视频中对象中心表示学习的挑战，并在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界应用（如手术）中的异构场景难以解析为有意义的一组槽，现有方法在手术视频上表现不佳。

Method: 提出动态时序槽变换器（DTST）模块，结合时序推理和预测未来最优槽初始化。

Result: 在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于现实世界数据，并成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了多模态基础模型（如GPT-4o等）在标准计算机视觉任务中的表现，发现它们虽不及专业模型，但作为通用模型表现尚可，且在语义任务上优于几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态基础模型在视觉理解方面的实际能力，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过提示链将标准视觉任务转化为文本可提示和API兼容的任务，建立标准化评估框架。

Result: 模型在语义任务上表现较好，但不及专业模型；GPT-4o在非推理模型中表现最佳；推理模型在几何任务上有改进。

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在视觉任务中表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SPRED框架，通过动态原型引导的伪标签生成和新旧知识协作净化，解决了半监督终身行人重识别（Semi-LReID）问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中标注资源有限，现有方法在利用未标注数据时性能下降严重，需要解决噪声知识问题。

Method: 引入可学习的身份原型动态捕获身份分布并生成高质量伪标签，结合新旧知识协作净化噪声伪标签。

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED通过自增强循环设计，显著提升了未标注数据的利用效率和长期学习性能。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

### [445] [Locality-aware Parallel Decoding for Efficient Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01957)
*Zhuoyang Zhang,Luke J. Huang,Chengyue Wu,Shang Yang,Kelly Peng,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) accelerates autoregressive image generation by introducing flexible parallelization and locality-aware ordering, reducing steps significantly without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive image generation is memory-bound and slow; existing parallelization methods achieve limited success.

Method: LPD uses Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling for arbitrary generation ordering and Locality-aware Generation Ordering to minimize dependencies.

Result: Reduces generation steps from 256 to 20 (256x256) and 1024 to 48 (512x512) with at least 3.4x lower latency.

Conclusion: LPD achieves high parallelization and maintains generation quality, significantly improving efficiency.

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，用于解决复杂隐式假设指令的图像编辑问题，通过多模态大语言模型和细粒度推理线索提取模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理需要深层推理的复杂隐式假设指令，且数据集和架构缺乏支持推理的能力。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型和细粒度推理线索提取模块（FRCE），并引入跨模态增强器（CME）减少语义损失。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中优于现有基线方法，并在传统图像编辑任务中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数字孪生（DT）的管道，用于评估变形图像配准（DIR）方法在胃肠道（GI）器官运动中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间准确性指标，但手动标记地标对于高度移动的GI器官具有挑战性。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个运动阶段的4D序列，模拟GI运动，并评估六种DIR方法的性能。

Result: 生成的DT模拟了真实的GI运动，运动幅度与真实患者数据相似，并提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射准确性验证。

Conclusion: 该管道能够严格测试DIR工具在动态、解剖复杂区域的性能，支持空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多季节信息融合框架，结合休眠期和生长期的RGB-D图像，用于果园自动化管理，提升机器视觉系统在密集树冠下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，生长期密集的树叶遮挡了树干和树枝结构，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠期树冠结构更清晰可见。

Method: 使用YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，融合多季节数据。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg在休眠期数据集上MSE为0.0047，mAP@50为0.78；Kinect Fusion重建误差小（树干直径RMSE为5.23 mm）；Fast GICP注册精度高（最小适应分数0.00197）。

Conclusion: 多季节融合框架显著提升了机器人系统在果园操作中的精度，克服了生长期遮挡问题。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

TL;DR: IC-Custom是一个统一的图像定制框架，通过上下文学习整合位置感知和无位置定制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化场景的应用。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用多模态注意力机制和任务导向的注册标记，结合高质量数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅训练0.4%的参数量。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

Result: 在ImageNet图像分类任务中表现优异，同时在多个视频数据集上显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: evMLP通过事件驱动机制有效减少了计算冗余，同时保持了与传统方法相当的输出一致性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code

Motivation: 长动画色彩化在动画产业中成本高，现有研究仅关注短期色彩化，缺乏全局信息导致长期色彩一致性不足。

Method: 提出LongAnimation框架，结合SketchDiT提取参考特征，DGLM模块动态融合全局历史特征与当前生成特征，并引入色彩一致性奖励优化结果。

Result: 实验表明，LongAnimation在短期（14帧）和长期（平均500帧）动画中均能有效保持色彩一致性。

Conclusion: 动态全局-局部范式显著提升了长动画色彩化的色彩一致性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

Conclusion: Kwai Keye-VL在短视频理解方面表现卓越，同时具备强大的通用视觉语言能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.
