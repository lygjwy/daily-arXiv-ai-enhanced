### [2] [Context Attribution with Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19977)
*Deng Pan,Keerthiram Murugesan,Nuno Moniz,Nitesh Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合多臂老虎机（CMAB）的框架，用于高效探索上下文子集，以解释大语言模型的生成答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解检索到的上下文中哪些部分对生成答案有贡献，是构建可解释和可信的生成式问答系统的关键。

Method: 将上下文属性建模为CMAB问题，使用组合汤普森采样（CTS）在有限查询预算下高效探索上下文子集，定义基于归一化标记似然的奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持高属性保真度的同时，显著提高了查询效率，且仅需较少的模型查询即可达到竞争性属性质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应平衡探索与利用，优于传统的基于扰动的属性方法（如SHAP），为生成式问答系统提供了高效且可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
potential in code generation, yet their effectiveness in quantum computing
remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum
code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack).
We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack
competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework
assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success
across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced
models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately
generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex
quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation
pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing
execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly
releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental
results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.

### [4] [Accurate and Energy Efficient: Local Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models Outperform Commercial Large Language Models in Medical Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20009)
*Konstantinos Vrettos,Michail E. Klontzas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种可定制的RAG框架，用于医疗任务，其性能和能耗优于商业LLM，同时减少环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的广泛应用引发了对环境和伦理问题的担忧，尤其是商业LLM的高资源消耗和隐私问题。

Method: 开发了监控能耗和CO2排放的RAG框架，基于开源LLM（如llama3.1:8b和medgemma-4b-it）构建模型，并与商业模型（DeepSeekV3-R1和o4-mini）对比。

Result: llama3.1:8B的RAG模型在准确率（58.5%）和能耗（0.52性能/kWh，473g CO2）上表现最佳，优于商业模型。

Conclusion: 本地LLM构建的RAG在医疗任务中优于商业LLM，且更环保，符合可持续发展目标。

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

### [6] [Persona-Assigned Large Language Models Exhibit Human-Like Motivated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20020)
*Saloni Dash,Amélie Reymond,Emma S. Spiro,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在分配特定身份角色后，会表现出类似人类的动机性推理，导致判断偏差，且传统去偏方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否会在身份角色诱导下表现出动机性推理，从而影响其判断能力，尤其是在政治和社会议题上。

Method: 通过为8种LLMs分配8种政治和社会人口属性角色，测试其在信息真实性辨别和科学证据评估任务中的表现。

Result: 身份角色导致LLMs在信息真实性辨别上准确率下降9%，政治角色在科学证据评估中与身份一致的结论正确率提高90%。去偏提示方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出类似人类的动机性推理，且难以通过传统方法纠正，可能加剧身份一致性推理的问题。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

### [7] [DiaLLMs: EHR Enhanced Clinical Conversational System for Clinical Test Recommendation and Diagnosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20059)
*Weijieying Ren,Tianxiang Zhao,Lei Wang,Tianchun Wang,Vasant Honavar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiaLLM是一种新型医疗大语言模型，整合电子健康记录（EHR）数据，支持临床测试推荐、结果解释和诊断预测，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型忽视电子健康记录（EHR）的作用，仅关注诊断推荐，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 提出DiaLLM，通过临床测试参考（CTR）策略整合EHR数据，采用强化学习框架进行证据获取和自动诊断，并引入拒绝采样策略和奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明DiaLLM在临床测试推荐和诊断预测方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据和改进的强化学习框架，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms
baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.

### [8] [AI Copilots for Reproducibility in Science: A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20130)
*Adrien Bibal,Steven N. Minton,Deborah Khider,Yolanda Gil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenPub是一个AI驱动的平台，通过模块化助手支持开放科学任务，特别是可重复性助手，显著减少研究复现时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放科学倡议希望提高研究的透明度和可重复性，但独立复现研究成果仍具挑战性。

Method: OpenPub的可重复性助手分析论文、代码和补充材料，生成结构化Jupyter Notebook和建议。

Result: 测试显示，OpenPub将复现时间从30多小时缩短至1小时，并高覆盖率复现图表和结果。

Conclusion: AI工具可有效减轻复现负担，促进透明科学交流，模块化架构支持扩展其他开放科学目标。

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

### [9] [Language Modeling by Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20249)
*Junyan Cheng,Peter Clark,Kyle Richardson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用多智能体LLM方法Genesys，通过遗传编程和逐步验证，发现高效的语言模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用LLM模拟研究过程，以发现新颖的语言模型架构。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM方法，结合遗传编程和逐步验证（从14M到350M参数）。

Result: 生成了1,162个新设计，其中1,062个通过验证，部分设计在6/9基准测试中优于GPT2和Mamba2。

Conclusion: Genesys系统在自主发现高效架构方面具有潜力，并提供了系统级洞见。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

*Liya Wang,David Yi,Damien Jose,John Passarelli,James Gao,Jordan Leventis,Kang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Bloom分类法的14任务框架，评估企业环境中大语言模型能力，开发可扩展标注流程，构建9700样本基准，发现开源模型在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中落后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如MMLU）未能充分评估企业特定任务的复杂性，需更全面的评估框架。

Method: 结合LLM-as-a-Labeler、LLM-as-a-Judge和CRAG技术，开发可扩展标注流程，构建9700样本基准。

Result: 开源模型在推理任务中表现接近专有模型，但在判断任务中落后，可能因过度思考。

Conclusion: 提供企业定制化评估蓝图，推动大语言模型的实际部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

### [11] [Mobile-R1: Towards Interactive Reinforcement Learning for VLM-Based Mobile Agent via Task-Level Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20332)
*Jihao Gu,Qihang Ai,Yingyao Wang,Pi Bu,Jingxuan Xing,Zekun Zhu,Wei Jiang,Ziming Wang,Yingxiu Zhao,Ming-Liang Zhang,Jun Song,Yuning Jiang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Mobile-R1方法，通过任务级奖励的多轮交互强化学习提升移动代理的探索和纠错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注离线强化学习或动作级奖励的在线优化，限制了代理与环境的动态交互，导致局部最优和探索能力不足。

Method: 采用三阶段训练框架：初始格式微调、动作级奖励的单步在线训练、任务级奖励的多轮轨迹在线训练。

Result: 显著提升了代理性能，并收集了包含28个中文应用的高质量数据集和500轨迹的基准。

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励和多轮交互强化学习，有效增强了移动代理的探索和纠错能力。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

*Sungwon Han,Sungkyu Park,Seungeon Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REFeat的新方法，通过引导大型语言模型（LLM）利用多种推理类型生成多样且信息丰富的特征，解决了现有LLM方法生成特征过于简单或重复的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的特征生成方法存在特征过于简单或重复的问题，部分原因是LLM选择的转换存在固有偏差以及生成过程中缺乏结构化推理指导。

Method: 提出REFeat方法，通过多种推理类型引导LLM生成特征，并结合自适应策略选择。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上的实验表明，REFeat不仅平均预测准确率更高，还能发现更多样且有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将丰富的推理范式和自适应策略选择融入LLM驱动的特征发现中具有潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

open-source classifier model (used for labeling data as grounded or ungrounded)
engineered for robust performance in real-world scenarios, and the

Motivation: 随着电动汽车的普及和V2G技术的发展，需要解决电动汽车在服务系统中充放电管理的复杂问题，以最大化司机利润并支持电网。

Method: 提出EVOP-V2G问题，建立MIP模型，并设计进化算法（EA）和大邻域搜索（LNS）两种元启发式算法。

Result: 实验表明，算法能将司机利润提升至基线的两倍，并在小规模实例中接近最优，大规模实例中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为电动汽车服务系统提供了智能、高效的充放电管理方案，同时支持电网稳定。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

TL;DR: GymPN是一个基于深度强化学习的软件库，用于优化业务流程中的决策，支持部分流程可观察性和多决策建模，解决了先前工作的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 业务流程管理系统需要优化任务分配、执行时间和人员指派等决策，现有工具无法完全满足需求。

Method: 提出GymPN库，利用深度强化学习，支持部分流程可观察性和多决策建模。

Result: 在八种典型业务流程决策问题模式上验证了GymPN的有效性，能够轻松建模并学习最优决策策略。

Conclusion: GymPN解决了先前工作的局限性，能够更真实地表示业务流程决策。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI设计和构建感知能力提供清晰定义，避免无意中创造具有感知能力的AI。

Method: 提出感知需具备断言性和质性，并探讨了当前技术下的实现方法。

Result: 定义了功能性感知的具体要求，并提供了实现思路。

Conclusion: 明确AI感知的功能性定义有助于避免无意创造，并促进及时识别。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中，自动驾驶需要快速且上下文感知的决策能力，但现有大语言模型（LLMs）在领域适应、上下文理解和经验知识方面存在不足。

Method: 提出CBR-LLM框架，结合语义场景理解和历史案例检索，利用风险感知提示策略和相似性案例检索优化决策。

Result: 实验表明，该框架提高了决策准确性、解释质量以及与人类专家行为的一致性，并在多样风险场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: CBR-LLM框架为智能驾驶系统提供了一种自适应且可信的决策支持工具，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Conclusion: 多代理AI框架有效支持了可持续蛋白质研究，未来可扩展化学安全搜索功能。

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Result: 初步评估了系统架构、RAG和重排序的效果，以及不同LLM和嵌入模型的性能，展示了LLM在科学软件开发中的潜力。

Conclusion: 目标是建立一个可扩展的知识中心化AI框架，以支持科学软件的开发和研究，加速科学发现。

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader

Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at
exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Decrypto，一个基于游戏的多智能体推理和心智理论（ToM）基准测试，填补了现有评测的不足，并验证了前沿大语言模型（LLMs）在多智能体场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）具备代理能力，它们需要在复杂的多智能体场景中与人类和其他代理交互，但目前对LLMs在多智能体能力和心智理论（ToM）方面的理解不足，现有评测存在范围狭窄、数据泄漏等问题。

Method: 提出Decrypto，一个基于认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习的游戏基准测试，设计简单且消除干扰因素，并进行了全面的实证评估、鲁棒性研究和人机交叉实验。

Result: 发现LLMs的游戏能力落后于人类和简单的词嵌入基线模型，且在经典认知科学实验变体中，前沿推理模型表现不如旧版本。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评测的关键空白，为开发更好的智能代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标优化在机器学习和工程中应用广泛，但现有方法在收敛速度和样本复杂度上表现不佳，因此需要更高效的算法。

Method: 提出STIMULUS算法，采用递归框架更新随机梯度估计；进一步引入动量项（STIMULUS-M）和自适应批处理（STIMULUS+/STIMULUS-M+）。

Result: 在非凸和强凸设置下分别实现了$O(1/T)$和$O(\exp{-\mu T})$的收敛速度，样本复杂度达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: STIMULUS及其变体在收敛速度和样本复杂度上显著优于传统方法，为MOO问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Koopman理论的飞行轨迹预测模型效率低、可解释性差且计算量大，需改进。

Method: 结合HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程，直接构建Koopman算子，减少可训练参数。

Result: FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上表现优越，训练时间短，内存减少超50%，参数减少十倍。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，为时间序列预测与控制结合开辟了新可能。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

Result: 霍克斯过程模型拟合人类眼跳更好，但上下文惊奇对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇理论难以解释精细眼动行为，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了带宽、CPU频率和用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 提出PS-CDDPG算法，结合DDPG和因果推理，优化关键帧比例、带宽和计算资源。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了交互延迟，提升了QoE，并保持了公平性。

Conclusion: 该框架在多用户VR交互中表现优于基准方法。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DeKA-g算法，通过知识蒸馏和对无线信道的自适应优化，提升生成语义通信（GSC）系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI生成内容（AIGC）的激增，从云端向边缘和移动用户传输内容导致网络流量大幅增加。生成语义通信（GSC）通过传输紧凑信息（如提示文本和潜在表示）而非高维AIGC数据，提供了解决方案。然而，GSC依赖于云端生成AI（GAI）与边缘及用户知识之间的对齐，以及无线传输知识与实际信道知识之间的对齐，这仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出DeKA-g算法，包括两种新方法：元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变速率分组SNR自适应（VGSA）。MAKD通过优化元词提升知识蒸馏效率，VGSA则实现对不同压缩率和SNR范围的高效自适应。

Result: 实验表明，DeKA-g将边缘生成图像与云端生成图像的对齐度提升44%，压缩率自适应效率比基线高116%，在低SNR条件下性能提升28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g通过知识蒸馏和自适应优化，显著提升了GSC系统的性能，解决了知识对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度神经网络（DNN）和可解释人工智能（XAI）的方法，用于预测电力市场价格并分析其驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力市场高度复杂，传统计量经济学方法（白盒模型）在预测能力上不如DNN，但缺乏可解释性。本文旨在通过XAI方法增强对电力市场价格动态的理解。

Method: 使用DNN预测价格，并应用SHAP、Gradient等XAI方法及热图（显著性图）分析五个电力市场中各特征的行为和贡献。提出了SSHAP值和SSHAP线的新概念。

Result: 通过XAI方法成功揭示了电力市场价格动态的驱动因素，并增强了高维表格模型的复杂表示能力。

Conclusion: 结合DNN和XAI的方法不仅能提高预测准确性，还能提供对电力市场运作的深入理解，为未来研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于训练案例检索的后处理框架，通过测量决策变化和层不确定性来增强神经网络的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断和自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能导致严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法。

Method: 基于查询的激活向量检索相似训练案例，提出决策变化和层不确定性两个新指标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上，新指标优于基于softmax的置信度估计。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升不确定性估计，尤其在复杂分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

Motivation: 轴承故障可能导致严重运营中断和维护成本，现有方法依赖大量标记数据且适应性不足。

Method: 采用深度Q网络（DQN）进行轴承故障分类，优化奖励结构以提升适应性。

Result: RL模型在控制条件下与传统方法性能相当，但在适应性上表现更优，计算需求较高。

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational
disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis
rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often
require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive
diagnostic frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较AR和MDM范式时，架构差异导致不公平对比，研究旨在解耦范式与架构的影响。

Method: 在解码器框架下评估MDM（称为Any-Order AR），分析其与标准AR的差异及架构影响。

Result: 解码器MDM在生成速度上显著提升（约25倍），困惑度相当，但建模空间更大。

Conclusion: 研究解耦了范式与架构的影响，为未来模型设计提供见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽视特征组的联合信号，而许多情况下最重要的预测因子是特征组的组合效应，尤其是在多模态数据集中。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，计算特征组的重要性，具有高效性、无需模型重训练、支持事后定义组和重叠组的特点。

Result: 在合成实验和两个实际案例（抑郁症症状识别和髋关节置换术后健康社会决定因素）中验证了方法的有效性，表明特征组分析比单特征分析更准确全面。

Conclusion: 分析特征组的重要性能够提供更准确、全面的视角，尤其在医学问题中具有重要意义。

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

Motivation: 复杂数据集的快速增长需要既能有效分组数据又能提供人类可理解洞察的工具。

Conclusion: HERCULES展示了从复杂数据中提取层次化知识的潜力，增强了聚类的可解释性。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Result: TRACED在多个基准测试中显著提升零样本泛化能力，且环境交互需求减少至基线的一半。

Conclusion: 通过优化遗憾近似和任务关系建模，TRACED实现了高效的课程设计。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Conclusion: RF神经元的引入为高效处理时域信号提供了新途径，显著降低了边缘计算的能耗。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

Result: 在IBM量子硬件和Qiskit Aer模拟器上实现约90%的准确率，远超传统方法的55%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应的微调，显著提升了量子联邦学习在医疗和基因组研究等复杂挑战中的适用性。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Conclusion: DIM-SUM能有效处理真实缺失模式，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

Result: 发现损失加权在中间参数化设置下仍有效，但需考虑模型的相对过参数化。

Conclusion: 损失加权在中间参数化设置下有效，但需调整以反映模型的过参数化程度。

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

Conclusion: 该框架为多代理任务分配提供了高效的多样化COA生成方法，适用于动态环境和异构代理场景。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge

Conclusion: CLVQVAE为跨层特征演化分析提供了新思路，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为LSH-DynED的新方法，通过结合局部敏感哈希与随机超平面投影（LSH-RHP）和动态集成多样化（DynED）框架，解决了多类不平衡数据流分类的挑战。实验表明，该方法在Kappa和mG-Mean指标上优于现有15种方法。

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在计算效率和精度上优于传统方法，适用于医疗领域的图数据。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of
pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the
perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows
that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型监督耦合矩阵-张量分解方法（SCMTF），用于结合患者报告结果（PROs）和实验室数据预测溃疡性结肠炎（UC）的药物持续性，解决了PRO数据稀疏和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者报告的症状（PROs）通常噪声大、主观性强且数据稀疏，常被排除在机器学习方法之外。本文旨在利用PROs数据，通过计算表型分析预测UC患者的药物持续性。

Method: 采用监督耦合矩阵-张量分解（SCMTF）方法，整合时间序列的PROs、实验室数据和静态特征，结合深度学习框架处理缺失数据。

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上预测8个月和20个月后药物变化的AUC分别为0.853和0.803，并提取了可解释的表型。

Conclusion: 低秩矩阵和张量分解方法可成功应用于UC领域和高度缺失的PRO数据，证明PROs包含通常被忽略的相关信息。

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

Motivation: 预测性维护对工业至关重要，但缺乏回归与分类方法的系统比较研究。

Method: 通过分析近期文献，比较回归（估计剩余使用寿命）和分类（预测故障概率）方法。

Result: 回归方法提供RUL估计，分类方法预测故障概率；挑战包括数据不平衡和高维特征。

Conclusion: 未来研究可关注混合方法、AI系统及实用工具（如公开数据集和开源工具）的发展。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM
research.

Motivation: 边缘环境资源有限且易发生故障，传统方法在延迟或准确性上存在不足，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: MEL框架通过多目标优化训练多个模型，鼓励模型多样性并保持独立性能。

Result: 实验表明，MEL在保持性能的同时提供容错能力，模型大小仅为原模型的40%，故障时仍保留95.6%的准确性。

Conclusion: MEL为边缘推理提供了一种高效、弹性的解决方案，适用于多种任务和平台。

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

Motivation: 现有方法在具有代数关系的动态系统中效率低下，而许多系统受反馈控制或守恒定律影响，需要新方法。

Method: PoV方法利用DIPCA确定代数关系数、动态关系数和约束矩阵，并通过条件数识别因果驱动变量。

Result: PoV方法能有效识别因果驱动变量，适用于纯动态系统和混合因果系统。

Conclusion: PoV方法在LTI-DAE系统中具有优越性，能处理更广泛的系统类型。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该框架将因果PDE发现定位为基于结构因果模型和变分残差分析的可解释推理任务。

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）部署成本高，现有剪枝方法未充分利用运行时激活稀疏性。

Method: 将激活稀疏性重新解释为动态结构化权重稀疏性，结合非结构化权重剪枝，引入激活感知校准和密集模型输出残差作为校正项。

Result: 在LLaMA-2和LLaMA-3上，DuoGPT在相同加速比下比现有结构化剪枝方法准确率提升高达9.17%。

Conclusion: DuoGPT通过双稀疏框架和优化GPU执行，显著提升了LLMs的部署效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Result: 实验表明，Anubis在区分不同LLM（如DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma等）时，仅需约2000样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis是一种有效的零样本归属工具，适用于LLM生成的代码来源分析。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

Motivation: 情感计算中存在启动效应导致的模糊性问题，目前研究多从标签角度解决，但对数据本身（尤其是生理信号）的影响研究不足。受启动效应影响的数据可能导致模型误分类。

Result: 使用无启动效应的数据序列训练模型时，误分类率显著降低。

Conclusion: 该研究通过数据层面识别和缓解启动效应，增强了模型鲁棒性，并为情感计算数据集的设计和收集提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“recourse-aware ensembling (RAE)”的方法，用于解决在模型多重性（MM）下提供反事实解释（CEs）的鲁棒性问题。通过计算论证方法，确保CEs在多模型环境下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习中，多个性能相同的模型可能对相同输入产生不同预测（模型多重性），导致反事实解释（CEs）的鲁棒性问题。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出RAE方法，利用计算论证技术显式表示模型与反事实之间的冲突，并通过论证语义解决冲突，确保CEs的鲁棒性。方法支持对模型的偏好设置。

Result: 理论分析展示了四种论证语义下的方法行为，并通过八种方法实例验证了其满足六项理想性质。

Conclusion: RAE方法有效解决了模型多重性下的反事实解释鲁棒性问题，支持灵活定制，并通过理论和实证验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器学习模型记忆训练数据的机制，指出仅依赖自影响（self-influence）会低估记忆风险，提出通过全影响分布（full influence distribution）更全面评估记忆效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和泛化问题。现有研究多关注自影响，但其他因素（如近重复样本）对记忆的影响被忽视。

Method: 通过计算训练样本间的全影响分布，分析其对记忆的影响，并在小语言模型和图像分类任务（CIFAR-10）中验证。

Result: 发现仅关注自影响会低估记忆风险，近重复样本虽降低自影响，但仍可被提取；全影响分布能揭示近重复样本的存在。

Conclusion: 记忆是训练数据间复杂相互作用的结果，全影响分布比自影响更能准确捕捉记忆现象。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

Motivation: 探索中等输入敏感性的学习函数，特别是在QR码解码任务中，验证Transformer模型的潜力。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行QR码解码实验，分析其对输入敏感性的适应能力。

Result: Transformer模型能够超越理论纠错限制，成功解码QR码，并能泛化到其他语言和随机字符串。

Conclusion: Transformer在QR码解码中表现出独特的机制，专注于数据位而非纠错位，为学习中等敏感性函数提供了新思路。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

Conclusion: 离策略REINFORCE算法通过调整基线V可以优化性能，尤其在强调高奖励样本时表现更佳，为大型语言模型对齐提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

Method: ILDE算法结合乐观策略优化（奖励高不确定性的状态-动作对）和好奇心驱动探索（探索偏离演示轨迹的状态）。

Result: ILDE在Atari和MuJoCo任务中样本效率更高，且能以更少演示实现超越专家性能。

Conclusion: ILDE是一种不确定性正则化的策略优化方法，具有乐观探索特性，理论证明其遗憾增长低于线性。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA适配器放置策略缺乏统一结论，不同研究对适配器放置位置（如注意力模块或MLP模块）有不同建议，亟需一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 通过直观的理论分析，提出PLoP方法，自动识别给定预训练模型和微调任务中LoRA适配器的最佳放置位置。

Result: PLoP在监督微调和强化学习推理任务中表现优于或至少与常用放置策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP为LoRA适配器放置提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，显著提升了模型微调的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Conclusion: 置换等变神经图CDEs在保持表达能力的同时，显著提升了效率和泛化性能。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Motivation: 传统线性VAR模型在GC分析中应用受限，现有深度学习方法将GC视为变量选择问题，本文旨在探索GC与预测的本质联系。

Method: 使用深度神经网络联合建模时间序列，通过比较模型残差分布（全输入与剔除特定时间序列）揭示GC结构，并研究输入层dropout的影响。

Result: 研究表明，经过良好正则化的模型可以从数据中学习真实的GC结构，无需在损失函数中显式添加稀疏回归项。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能够有效学习GC结构，为GC分析提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的计算需求和部署成本不断增加，现有SVD压缩方法忽视矩阵关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Method: 提出双级重要性保护机制：局部保护通过通道加权数据白化保留关键奇异向量；全局保护通过启发式或优化方法分配压缩负担，减少关键层的影响。

Result: 实验表明，DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有SVD压缩方法，尤其在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: DipSVD通过保护关键组件，显著提升了SVD压缩模型的性能，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

*Chanuka Don Samarasinghage,Dhruv Gulabani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分类学的特征选择方法，用于解决轨迹分析中的高维特征爆炸问题，提升模型效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹分析中高维特征导致数据效率和模型准确性下降，需要一种有效的特征选择方法。

Method: 提出基于分类学的特征选择方法，将特征分为几何和运动学两类，并进一步细分为曲率、凹陷、速度和加速度。

Result: 分类学方法在预测性能和特征选择时间上表现优异，同时增强了数据的可解释性。

Conclusion: 分类学方法为轨迹数据集提供了可解释性、降维和计算效率，推动了可解释人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: LaplaceGNN为高效学习表达性图表征提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present LaplaceGNN, a novel self-supervised graph learning framework that
bypasses the need for negative sampling by leveraging spectral bootstrapping
techniques. Our method integrates Laplacian-based signals into the learning
process, allowing the model to effectively capture rich structural
representations without relying on contrastive objectives or handcrafted
augmentations. By focusing on positive alignment, LaplaceGNN achieves linear
scaling while offering a simpler, more efficient, self-supervised alternative
for graph neural networks, applicable across diverse domains. Our contributions
are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth

and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. We present TESSERA, a
novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning

satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and
SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated
to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected
spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Motivation: 在非平稳环境中（如电子商务推荐系统），现有方法无法准确估计未来策略价值，因为未来环境的数据未在历史数据中观察到。

Method: 提出OPFV估计器，利用时间序列数据中的结构（如季节性、周效应等），通过新型重要性加权实现有效的未来策略评估。

Result: 理论分析表明OPFV在特定条件下具有低偏差，实验结果显示其在非平稳环境中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OPFV为未来策略评估和学习提供了有效工具，尤其在非平稳环境中表现优异。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端标签偏斜、数据量偏斜等异构性问题严重降低模型性能，且现有方法大多忽略大规模客户端中仅少数参与训练的场景。

Method: 提出KDIA策略，学生模型为参与客户端的平均聚合，教师模型为基于参与间隔、参与次数和数据量比例的加权聚合，并结合自知识蒸馏和生成器辅助训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10数据集上，KDIA在较少训练轮次下实现更高准确率，且在严重异构性下改进更显著。

Conclusion: KDIA能有效利用所有客户端知识，提升联邦学习在低参与率和异构性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the
loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at
so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the
prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to
automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Conclusion: FEA-PINN为LPBF过程提供了一种高效且准确的模拟方法。

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we
investigate transformer-based approaches for time series anomaly detection,
focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss

### [92] [Exploring Graph-Transformer Out-of-Distribution Generalization Abilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20575)
*Itay Niv,Neta Rabin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了图神经网络在分布外（OOD）泛化中的表现，重点比较了图变换器（GT）和混合架构与传统消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）的效果，并提出了一种新的后训练分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图学习方法通常假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但现实中这一条件很少满足。研究旨在评估不同架构在OOD环境下的泛化能力。

Method: 系统评估GT和混合架构在OOD设置中的表现，并比较MPNNs。同时提出一种新的后训练分析方法，分析ID和OOD数据的聚类结构。

Result: GT和混合架构在OOD泛化中表现优于MPNNs，无需专门领域泛化算法。后训练分析方法提供了对泛化能力的深入洞察。

Conclusion: 图变换器在现实图学习中具有更强的鲁棒性，为OOD泛化研究指明了新方向。

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

### [93] [The kernel of graph indices for vector search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20584)
*Mariano Tepper,Ted Willke*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的图索引方法SVG，适用于度量和非度量向量空间，并引入SVG-L0以优化图构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图索引方法仅适用于欧几里得空间，无法满足度量和非度量向量空间的需求。

Method: 利用核方法构建图索引SVG，并引入SVG-L0通过ℓ0稀疏约束限制出度。

Result: SVG和SVG-L0在度量和非度量空间中表现良好，且SVG-L0具有自调优特性。

Conclusion: SVG和SVG-L0为向量搜索提供了更通用的图索引方法，优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法（如符号回归和神经网络）难以准确捕捉复杂哈密顿函数并保持能量守恒，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出H-FEX方法，引入新型交互节点以捕捉复杂相互作用项。

Result: 实验表明，H-FEX能够恢复复杂系统的哈密顿函数，准确捕捉系统动态并长期保持能量守恒。

Conclusion: H-FEX是一种强大的框架，可用于发现复杂动力系统的闭式表达式。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Motivation: 研究闭环学习在大型神经网络模型中的应用，探讨其参数动态和收敛行为。

Method: 针对指数族模型，推导参数动态的运动方程，分析最大似然估计和最大后验估计的影响。

Result: 最大似然估计会导致参数收敛到吸收状态，放大初始偏差；但可通过数据污染、正则化等方法避免。

Conclusion: 闭环学习的动态行为受参数化影响，需谨慎选择估计方法以避免偏差放大。

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

Result: 实验证明FedEDS能加速联邦学习的收敛速度，减轻数据异构性的负面影响。

Conclusion: FedEDS适合需要快速收敛的边缘设备应用服务，有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

Motivation: 解决在多专家系统中平衡准确性和计算成本的延迟分配问题，特别是在自然语言生成、图像处理和医疗诊断等领域。

Result: 实验验证了新方法的性能优于现有基线，并提供了低噪声假设下的增强理论保证。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在多专家延迟学习中具有理论一致性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

Motivation: 研究恶意服务器通过操纵全局模型获取客户端敏感信息的风险，并从防御者角度分析其实际可行性。

Method: 分析了攻击的有效性与隐蔽性之间的权衡，并提出了一种客户端检测机制。

Result: 发现攻击在实际联邦学习环境中效果有限且易被检测，提出的检测机制能有效防御。

Conclusion: 恶意梯度泄漏攻击在实践中受限，轻量级防御机制可行且易于部署。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用大语言模型和少样本翻译，通过迭代生成合成平行语料库来提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量，无需依赖大量平行数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言因缺乏平行语料库而难以实现高质量机器翻译的问题。

Method: 提出CycleDistill方法，通过零或少样本翻译从单语语料库生成合成平行数据，并用于模型微调。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，首轮迭代即可显著提升翻译质量（20-30 chrF点），且利用softmax激活进一步优化。

Conclusion: CycleDistill为低资源语言提供了一种高效且高质量的机器翻译解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Inference-Scaled GraphRAG的新框架，通过推理时计算扩展提升LLM在图推理任务中的表现，显著改进了多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏结构化上下文和多跳信息的访问。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（深度链式思维图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在交替推理-执行循环中实现推理时计算扩展。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，该方法显著优于传统GraphRAG和基线图遍历方法，提升了多跳问答性能。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展是一种实用且与架构无关的解决方案，可用于LLM的结构化知识推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有API代理依赖统一工具集，无法应对现实API的复杂性，构建跨领域工具代理仍具挑战性。

Method: Doc2Agent从API文档生成可执行工具，并通过代码代理迭代优化。

Result: 在真实API、WebArena和研究API上验证，性能提升55%，成本降低90%。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为从非结构化API文档构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和复杂长形式推理能力，限制了实际应用的广泛性。

Method: STReason利用上下文学习将复杂查询分解为模块化程序，无需任务特定微调，生成解决方案和详细解释。

Result: 实验显示STReason在复杂时空推理任务中显著优于现有模型，并通过人类评估验证其实用性。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更通用和强大的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

Result: SACL显著提升了代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提升12.8%），并改善了代码生成性能（如HumanEval上Pass@1提升4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL框架通过增强语义信息有效减少了代码检索的偏见，显著提升了检索和生成性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于错误率低，现有LLM校对放射学报告的PPV有限，需改进。

Method: 比较三种LLM框架：单提示检测器、提取器加检测器、提取器加检测器加假阳性验证器。

Result: 三阶段框架PPV显著提升至0.159，运营成本降低42.6%，检测性能稳定。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架为AI辅助放射学报告质量保证提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an

### [107] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性并减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估学习者的高阶能力（如表达能力和逻辑思维）需求增加，但传统构建响应测试的人工评分成本高且耗时。IRT虽能从不完整数据估计能力，但随着缺失分数比例增加，准确性下降。

Method: 利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数，以提高IRT能力估计的准确性。

Result: 新方法在能力估计中实现了高准确性，同时显著减少了人工评分工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效评估学习者能力提供了可行解决方案，尤其适用于稀疏或异构数据。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [108] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCRS的新评估框架，用于全面评估RAG系统的输出质量，包括上下文连贯性、问题相关性等多个方面，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面捕捉RAG输出的多维度质量，如上下文连贯性和事实准确性，且效率低下。

Method: 提出CCRS，基于预训练LLM的零样本端到端评估方法，包含五个指标：上下文连贯性、问题相关性、信息密度、答案正确性和信息召回。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证了CCRS的有效性，显示其能区分不同RAG系统性能，且计算效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了一种实用、全面且高效的评估框架。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

### [109] [AALC: Large Language Model Efficient Reasoning via Adaptive Accuracy-Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20160)
*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AALC是一种轻量级方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性，显著减少推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成冗长的思维链实现强大推理能力，但这种方法导致高延迟和成本，且准确性提升有限。

Method: AALC将验证准确性融入奖励机制，并采用动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟惩罚直到达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提高准确性，并减少冗余推理模式。

Conclusion: AALC展示了基于奖励的策略在引导LRMs实现高效、通用推理路径方面的潜力，但也可能降低模型的解释性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

### [110] [SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20167)
*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED是一种结构编码器，通过整合四个阶段（补丁提取、嵌入对齐、语义重编程和预测）来弥合时间序列预测中的结构-语义建模差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器缺乏语义推理能力，而大型语言模型（LLM）无法直接处理时间序列数据，限制了统一、可迁移预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED包含四个阶段：补丁提取的令牌感知编码器、嵌入对齐的投影模块、任务感知原型的语义重编程机制，以及冻结的语言模型预测。

Result: 实验表明，SEED在多个数据集上优于基线方法，有效解决了结构-语义建模差距。

Conclusion: SEED通过解耦表示学习和推理，实现了数值模式与语义推理的高效对齐，为时间序列预测提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN是一个不确定性保护选择框架，通过统计校准阈值在用户指定的FDR约束下筛选生成答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有启发式不确定性量化方法缺乏形式化保证的问题，特别是选择性预测中的FDR控制。

Method: 采用校准集估计经验错误率，并使用Clopper-Pearson等置信区间方法建立真实错误率的高概率上限。

Result: COIN在风险控制、保留合格答案的测试能力以及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现出色。

Conclusion: COIN具有扩展性和适应性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application
scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究探索了如何通过检索高质量示例提升大型语言模型在对话情感识别任务中的表现，发现增强示例检索方法优于其他技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多种应用中表现优异，但在主观任务（如情感识别）中实现高精度仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出基于随机和增强示例检索的策略，并分析对话上下文对情感识别准确性的影响。

Result: 增强示例检索在所有数据集（IEMOCAP、MELD、EmoryNLP）中表现最佳，表明其重要性。

Conclusion: 增强示例检索通过生成连贯且有目标的示例，显著提升了对话情感识别的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

TL;DR: 本文比较了捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型，通过内在和外在评估范式。内在评估使用Costra数据集和STS基准，外在评估通过COMET指标微调模型。结果显示内在语义相似性测试表现好的模型在下游任务中不一定表现优异，反之亦然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型在不同评估范式下的表现差异，揭示语义属性与下游任务之间的复杂关系。

Method: 内在评估使用Costra数据集和STS基准测试语义相似性、时间方面和风格变化；外在评估通过COMET指标微调模型用于机器翻译评估。

Result: 内在语义相似性测试表现优异的模型在下游翻译任务中不一定表现更好，而某些看似过度平滑的嵌入空间模型通过微调却能取得优异结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语义属性探测与下游任务之间的复杂关系，呼吁更多关于句子嵌入中'可操作语义'的研究或更深入的下游任务数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多视角方法，使用软标签处理NLP中的人类分歧，避免传统聚合方法忽视少数观点的问题。实验表明，该方法在主观任务中表现更优，但某些任务（如讽刺检测）的模型置信度较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法通过聚合标注者观点生成单一真实标签，但可能忽视少数观点。本研究旨在通过多视角方法更好地反映人类分歧，提升模型的包容性和多样性。

Method: 提出多视角方法，使用软标签替代传统聚合标签，并在多个主观文本分类任务（如仇恨言论、讽刺检测等）中验证其效果。

Result: 多视角方法在Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）和F1分数上优于传统方法，但在讽刺和立场检测任务中模型置信度较低。

Conclusion: 多视角方法能更好地捕捉人类分歧，提升模型性能，但需进一步解决高主观性任务中的置信度问题。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过结构化推理增强大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，结合监督微调和优化算法，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在复杂推理任务（如逻辑演绎和系统规划）中表现不佳，主要依赖隐式统计关系，缺乏结构化知识表示。

Method: 将非结构化数据转换为结构化格式，标注推理步骤，通过监督微调（SFT）训练LLMs，并采用GRPO优化算法（MAX-Flow和LCS）增强推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型上实现了简洁推理、鲁棒性能和优化兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理的集成有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块的自动流畅度评估方法，结合多种自监督学习模型和分层CNN-BiLSTM框架，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非母语者的语音流畅度评估（AFA）在捕捉语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用Silero-VAD将语音分段为呼吸组块，融合多种自监督学习模型的嵌入，并通过CNN-BiLSTM框架分析局部和长期依赖关系。

Result: 在Speechocean762和Avalinguo数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数分别提升了2.8/6.2和4.2/4.0。

Conclusion: 分块多自监督学习融合方法对流畅度评估具有鲁棒性，未来需探索其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

Motivation: 快速演变的媒体叙事需要动态追踪其发展，而现有方法在成本和规模上存在限制。

Method: 结合主题模型和变化点检测筛选代表性文档，再用大型语言模型分析内容与叙事变化。

Result: 大型语言模型能有效提取叙事变化，但在区分内容变化与叙事变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于动态追踪叙事变化，但在区分变化类型上仍需改进。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

Motivation: 临床文本通常难以获取，Biomed-Enriched提供了一个公开的大规模临床案例数据集，为生物医学和临床NLP提供资源。

Method: 通过大型语言模型标注400K段落，再微调小型模型扩展到PMC-OA语料库，提取高质量子集并进行质量过滤和领域上采样。

Result: 实验表明，临床上采样在MMLU ProfMed上提升5%，教育质量过滤在MedQA和MedMCQA上提升1%，组合方法能更快收敛。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched为生物医学预训练提供了高效且有效的策略，并提供了宝贵的公开临床案例资源。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce \name, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断因临床异质性、低患病率和医生对其不熟悉而具有挑战性，需要高效且准确的诊断工具。

Method: DeepRare由中央主机、长期记忆模块和专用代理服务器组成，整合40多种工具和最新医学知识，支持复杂诊断推理。

Result: 在8个数据集上评估，DeepRare对2919种疾病诊断准确率达100%（1013种疾病），在HPO评估中显著优于其他15种方法，Recall@1达57.18%。

Conclusion: DeepRare在罕见病诊断中表现出色，提供透明推理链和用户友好的Web应用，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个计算框架，用于量化对话中说话时间的分配及其动态过程，并通过实验验证了平衡对话更受欢迎，同时揭示了不同动态类型对参与者感知的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对话中说话时间的分配及其动态过程，以理解其对参与者感知的影响，并为计算机辅助通信平台设计提供工具。

Method: 引入一个计算框架，量化对话级说话时间分配及其动态，并应用到一个大型视频聊天数据集进行分析。

Result: 平衡对话更受欢迎，尤其是说话较少的一方；即使总体平衡相同，不同动态类型对感知有不同影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机辅助通信平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-人工智能通信。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过合并微调模型变体的层来压缩大语言模型（LLM）的新策略，显著减少了参数数量并保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）的部署和推理面临模型规模过大的挑战，现有方法主要关注单一模型剪枝，缺乏高效压缩策略。

Method: 将模型压缩问题转化为零阶优化问题，支持层移除、层选择和层合并三种操作。

Result: 实验表明，压缩后的模型（如Llama2-13B）在移除约25%参数的同时保持了97.3%的原性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM的高效压缩提供了新思路，显著提升了部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

TL;DR: ReCode框架通过强化学习帮助大语言模型适应动态API更新，提升代码生成性能，同时减少对通用代码生成能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在动态API环境下因依赖过时知识而表现不佳，需要一种方法使其能适应频繁的API更新。

Method: 构建数据集训练模型进行版本迁移，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习的奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升LLMs在动态API场景下的性能，尤其在未见过的任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: ReCode是一种有效且通用的方法，适用于不同LLMs和强化学习算法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Method: 通过分析Qwen和Llama模型家族，研究了中训练策略对RL动态的影响，并提出了一种两阶段训练方法。

Result: 发现高质量数学语料和QA数据能显著提升RL性能，但需注意数据格式化；提出的Stable-then-Decay策略显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为RL时代的基础模型预训练策略提供了重要见解，并开源了模型和语料库。

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

Motivation: LLM代理在高风险领域中的不道德行为可能导致严重后果，如物理伤害和经济损失，因此需要一种高效的方法来引导其行为。

Method: 将代理行为引导任务建模为模型编辑任务，并引入多层次的基准BehaviorBench，基于心理学道德理论评估和编辑代理行为。

Result: Behavior Editing能够动态调整代理在特定场景中的行为，并实现全局道德对齐的广泛调整，既能促进道德行为，也能诱导有害行为。

Conclusion: Behavior Editing为代理行为引导提供了新范式，展示了其潜力和风险。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Motivation: 探索dLLMs在代码生成中的优势，解决其训练和推理机制尚未充分研究的问题。

Method: 训练7B参数的dLLM模型DiffuCoder，分析其解码行为，并提出coupled-GRPO采样方案以优化强化学习训练。

Result: DiffuCoder在代码生成基准测试中性能提升4.4%，减少了对自回归解码的依赖。

Conclusion: dLLMs在代码生成中具有独特优势，coupled-GRPO框架为其提供了高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：分解问题、动态构建事实数据库、整合信息解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了性能，如PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，2WikiMultiHopQA上F1分数提升超过20个百分点。

Conclusion: Memento是一种有效的策略，能够显著提升LLMs在多跳问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs如何在复杂社交情境中权衡冲突目标（如传达真相与维护信任），并填补现有工具在动态价值权衡分析上的不足。

Method: 方法采用认知科学中的礼貌语言认知模型，系统评估LLMs在推理模型和开源模型中的价值权衡，分析训练动态。

Result: 结果显示推理模型更注重信息效用，而开源模型在数学推理中表现更强；训练早期对价值权衡有显著影响。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法适用于快速发展的LLM领域，有助于优化训练策略和控制价值权衡。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Abstract: Application rate errors when using self-propelled agricultural sprayers for
agricultural production remain a concern. Among other factors, spray boom
instability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray
booms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and
machine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of
these booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the
extent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include
boom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was
conducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom
movement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was
developed to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO
V7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's
movements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the
vertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the
boom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output. The
results showed that the model could detect the target with more than 90 percent
accuracy, and distance estimates of the target on the boom were within 0.026 m
of the inclinometer sensor data. This system can quantify the boom movement on
the current sprayer and potentially on any other sprayer with minor
modifications. The data can be used to make design improvements to make sprayer
booms more stable and achieve greater application accuracy.

Conclusion: EBC-ZIP通过更合理的概率损失，有效解决稀疏性问题，提升人群计数性能。

Abstract: Density map estimation has become the mainstream paradigm in crowd counting.
However, most existing methods overlook the extreme sparsity of ground-truth
density maps. In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions
(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count
distributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating
dense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss
functions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly
assume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,
non-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting
framework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated
Poisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional
regression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,
enabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count
accuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)
framework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of
targets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance
through a more principled probabilistic loss. We also evaluate EBC-ZIP with
backbones of varying computational complexity to assess its scalability.
Extensive experiments on four crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that
EBC-ZIP consistently outperforms EBC and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: ToSA是一种高效的ViT加速解决方案，能更好地保留关键场景结构。

Abstract: Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision
Transformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods
primarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,
overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve
as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the
visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose
ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial
awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as
input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial
information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial
awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves
critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA
outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual
and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,
making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration. The code will be

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域缺乏对3D认知世界模型技术的系统分类和分析，因此需要提供一个结构化的综述。

Method: 引入概念框架，分析3D表示和世界知识的技术驱动，并探讨3D物理场景生成、空间推理和空间交互三大核心能力。

Result: 总结了3D世界模型在具体应用中的部署情况，并指出了数据、建模和部署中的挑战。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention in the development of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), serving as computational frameworks for
learning representations of the external world and forecasting future states.
While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent
3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize
geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward
3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic
analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing
3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a
conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of
world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this
framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in
3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental
pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that
underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,
and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these
capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous
driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across
data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing
more robust and generalizable 3D world models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

Conclusion: LAASP方法通过自动化和高效的剪枝策略，显著减少了计算量并保持了模型性能，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

Abstract: Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing
applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be
challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is
better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an
image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle
exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an
exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image
diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is
optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms
baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在视觉退化条件下容易产生OCR幻觉，导致依赖语言先验或视觉-文本推理错位，需要新的评估方法和解决方案。

Method: 提出KIE-HVQA基准测试，模拟真实退化场景；引入GRPO框架，结合视觉不确定性自感知和拒绝回答机制，通过监督微调和强化学习减少幻觉。

Result: 7B参数模型在KIE-HVQA上比GPT-4o减少22%的幻觉，且在标准任务中性能无明显下降。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效减少视觉退化条件下的幻觉问题，同时保持模型在标准任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced
document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,
existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world
scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the
current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation
and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned
visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently
results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise
answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and
problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR
hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test
samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world
degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'
capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and
answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding
hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and
thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based
framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness
of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer
to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous
regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model
achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o
on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,
highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: 探索预训练模型在地球观测任务中的复用与组合，以提供更通用、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用GEO-Bench基准测试评估多个预训练模型（如Prithvi、Hiera、DOFA）在11个数据集上的表现，采用特征级集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 特征级集成小模型性能可媲美或超越大模型，且训练时间和计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 预训练模型组合及知识蒸馏为地球观测任务提供了高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by
enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene
classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial
domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using
massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains
underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In
this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote
sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve
performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the
GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi,
Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions,
sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level
ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of
much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational
resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge
distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models,
offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth
Observation applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wald协议生成的合成数据无法准确模拟真实世界的退化模式，限制了深度图像融合模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PADM模块，通过两个子网络（PAlignNet和PDegradeNet）自适应学习退化过程；引入HFreqdiff框架，结合CFB和BACM模块提取高频细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PADM和HFreqdiff有效解决了传统方法的局限性，显著提升了图像融合性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds
high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM
modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process
learning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution
panchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial
sharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
proposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: UniCode$^2$在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持高质量视觉合成，且无需牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性。

Conclusion: UniCode$^2$证明了在不牺牲稳定性、语义或模块性的情况下扩展视觉标记空间的可行性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in
jointly advancing multimodal understanding and generation, with visual
codebooks discretizing images into tokens for autoregressive modeling. Existing
codebook-based methods either rely on small vocabularies (~16K entries) that
lack fine-grained semantics or naively scale up, resulting in low token
utilization and unstable training. We propose UniCode$^2$, a cascaded codebook
framework enabling large-scale, semantically aligned, and stable visual
tokenization. By clustering millions of SigLIP sequence embeddings, we build a
500K-entry codebook that preserves vision-language alignment while expanding
capacity. Stability is ensured via a cascaded design: a frozen codebook anchors
the embedding space, and a trainable codebook refines task-specific semantics.
This decoupling promotes high utilization and robust learning. Moreover, the
alignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless
integration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual
synthesis with minimal adaptation. UniCode^2 delivers strong performance across
diverse benchmarks, demonstrating the viability of scaling visual token spaces
without sacrificing stability, semantics, or modularity.

Abstract: Event cameras asynchronously capture pixel-level intensity changes with
extremely low latency. They are increasingly used in conjunction with RGB
cameras for a wide range of vision-related applications. However, a major
challenge in these hybrid systems lies in the transmission of the large volume
of triggered events and RGB images. To address this, we propose a transmission
scheme that retains efficient reconstruction performance of both sources while
accomplishing real-time deblurring in parallel. Conventional RGB cameras and
event cameras typically capture the same scene in different ways, often
resulting in significant redundant information across their outputs. To address
this, we develop a joint event and image (E-I) transmission framework to
eliminate redundancy and thereby optimize channel bandwidth utilization. Our
approach employs Bayesian modeling and the information bottleneck method to
disentangle the shared and domain-specific information within the E-I inputs.
This disentangled information bottleneck framework ensures both the compactness
and informativeness of extracted shared and domain-specific information.
Moreover, it adaptively allocates transmission bandwidth based on scene
dynamics, i.e., more symbols are allocated to events for dynamic details or to
images for static information. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to
conventional systems but also delivers enhanced deblurring performance.

Abstract: The complexity and diversity of surgical workflows, driven by heterogeneous
operating room settings, institutional protocols, and anatomical variability,
present a significant challenge in developing generalizable models for
cross-institutional and cross-procedural surgical understanding. While recent
surgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer
promising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by
domain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To
address this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight
framework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation
models to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages
few-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with
institution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal
consistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived
from institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time
adaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase
prediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a
self-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution
shifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to
rapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural
language text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a
task graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the
SPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase
recognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming
full-shot models with 32-shot labeled data. Code is available at

Result: 在IAMOn-DB和VNOn-DB数据集上达到最优准确率，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: 通过早期融合多模态数据，显著提升了手写识别的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

Conclusion: HMDRN通过双层次重建增强类间区分，掩码增强减少类内差异，展示了优越的特征重建能力。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained image classification (FS-FGIC) presents a significant
challenge, requiring models to distinguish visually similar subclasses with
limited labeled examples. Existing methods have critical limitations:
metric-based methods lose spatial information and misalign local features,
while reconstruction-based methods fail to utilize hierarchical feature
information and lack mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions. We propose
the Hierarchical Mask-enhanced Dual Reconstruction Network (HMDRN), which
integrates dual-layer feature reconstruction with mask-enhanced feature
processing to improve fine-grained classification. HMDRN incorporates a
dual-layer feature reconstruction and fusion module that leverages
complementary visual information from different network hierarchies. Through
learnable fusion weights, the model balances high-level semantic
representations from the last layer with mid-level structural details from the
penultimate layer. Additionally, we design a spatial binary mask-enhanced
transformer self-reconstruction module that processes query features through
adaptive thresholding while maintaining complete support features, enhancing
focus on discriminative regions while filtering background noise. Extensive
experiments on three challenging fine-grained datasets demonstrate that HMDRN
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Conv-4 and ResNet-12
backbone architectures. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component, revealing that dual-layer
reconstruction enhances inter-class discrimination while mask-enhanced
transformation reduces intra-class variations. Visualization results provide
evidence of HMDRN's superior feature reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

Abstract: Dense prediction tasks hold significant importance of computer vision, aiming
to learn pixel-wise annotated label for an input image. Despite advances in
this field, existing methods primarily focus on idealized conditions, with
limited generalization to real-world scenarios and facing the challenging
scarcity of real-world data. To systematically study this problem, we first
introduce DenseWorld, a benchmark spanning a broad set of 25 dense prediction
tasks that correspond to urgent real-world applications, featuring unified
evaluation across tasks. Then, we propose DenseDiT, which maximally exploits
generative models' visual priors to perform diverse real-world dense prediction
tasks through a unified strategy. DenseDiT combines a parameter-reuse mechanism
and two lightweight branches that adaptively integrate multi-scale context,
working with less than 0.1% additional parameters. Evaluations on DenseWorld
reveal significant performance drops in existing general and specialized

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从光谱域解决未注册高光谱图像（HSI）和多光谱图像（MSI）融合问题的方法，包括光谱先验学习（SPL）网络和盲稀疏融合（BSF）方法，提高了注册和融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过空间变换对齐HSI和MSI，但由于分辨率差异大且处理大尺寸图像耗时，效果不佳。

Method: 1. 开发SPL网络提取HSI光谱特征并增强MSI光谱分辨率；2. 使用子空间表示和循环训练策略提高注册HSI的光谱精度；3. 提出BSF方法，利用群稀疏正则化等效促进图像低秩性；4. 使用PAO算法求解BSF模型。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验验证了该方法在注册、融合和分类性能提升方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法从光谱域解决了注册问题，显著提高了融合效率和分类性能。

Abstract: The blind fusion of unregistered hyperspectral images (HSIs) and
multispectral images (MSIs) has attracted growing attention recently. To
address the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial
transformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to
the substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the
performance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the
registration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized
images in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the
registration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight
Spectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features
from the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,
the obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered
HSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are
employed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we
propose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity
regularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This
approach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces
computational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization
(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are
conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.
We also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.

*Shunqi Mao,Wei Guo,Chaoyi Zhang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ctrl-Z Sampling的新采样策略，用于在条件生成中检测和逃离局部最优解，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成中容易陷入局部最优解，导致全局不一致或条件不对齐的问题。

Method: 通过奖励模型识别局部最优解，注入噪声并回退到更早状态以逃离，动态交替前向细化和后向探索。

Result: 实验表明，Ctrl-Z Sampling显著提升生成质量，仅增加约7.6倍的函数评估。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Z Sampling是一种模型无关的方法，可兼容现有扩散框架，有效提升生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by
progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This
denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned
latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of
higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima
that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally
misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior
efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or
manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random
Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect
and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first
identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it
injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current
optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,
accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat
enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random
zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and
backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the
generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and
compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that
Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X
increase in function evaluations.

Abstract: Images captured in challenging environments often experience various forms of
degradation, including noise, color cast, blur, and light scattering. These
effects significantly reduce image quality, hindering their applicability in
downstream tasks such as object detection, mapping, and classification. Our
transformer-based diffusion model was developed to address image restoration
tasks, aiming to improve the quality of degraded images. This model was
evaluated against existing deep learning methodologies across multiple quality
metrics for underwater image enhancement, denoising, and deraining on publicly

with transformers, surpasses current methods in performance. The results of our
model highlight the efficacy of diffusion models and transformers in improving
the quality of degraded images, consequently expanding their utility in
downstream tasks that require high-fidelity visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射组学方法使用固定特征集，无法充分代表个体病理变化，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用深度学习模型动态预测每位患者的特征相关性，结合低维逻辑回归进行分类。

Result: 在多任务诊断中表现优于或媲美端到端深度学习模型，同时提供临床洞察。

Conclusion: 新框架结合了高性能和可解释性，为临床诊断和生物标志物发现提供了潜力。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of knee MRI scans relies on expert clinical judgment,
often with high variability and limited scalability. Existing radiomic
approaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at
the population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While
interpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent
individual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based
approaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent
end-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic
features. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic
selection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the
poor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic
fingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is
dynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the
existing radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient
basis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and
selecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual
patients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a
low-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for
downstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic
tasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
tears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic
accuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models. More importantly,
we show that the interpretability inherent in our approach facilitates
meaningful clinical insights and potential biomarker discovery, with detailed
discussion, quantitative and qualitative analysis of real-world clinical cases
to evidence these advantages.

Motivation: 突发性现象在SFR中广泛存在，导致训练和评估阶段的性能下降，需要检测并抑制这种现象。

Method: 提出基于Quickshift++、特征自相似性和广义最大池化（GMP）的三种策略检测突发性人脸，并在训练和评估阶段调整采样比例，同时提出质量感知GMP。

Result: 实验证明突发性现象普遍存在，抑制突发性显著提升了识别性能。

Conclusion: 通过检测和抑制突发性现象，可以有效提升SFR的性能，尤其是在非约束场景下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Burstiness, a phenomenon observed in text and image retrieval, refers to that
particular elements appear more times in a set than a statistically independent
model assumes. We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition
(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:
Firstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist
frequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the
training face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained
scenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere
with the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when
evaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies
based on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling
(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages
to enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When
evaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables
awareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the
original GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR
benchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing
burstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.

*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的性能，发现Transformer和CNN-OBB模型各有优势，OBB对非笛卡尔布局至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档布局复杂，自动化处理需要鲁棒的文档布局分析（DLA），因此需要评估不同模型在复杂数据集上的表现。

Method: 在三个数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE）上测试了五种目标检测模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO、YOLO三种变体），比较了它们的性能。

Result: Co-DETR在e-NDP上表现最佳（0.752 mAP），而YOLOv11x-OBB在更复杂的CATMuS和HORAE上表现更好（0.564和0.568）。OBB对非笛卡尔布局至关重要。

Conclusion: Transformer适合结构化布局，CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档上泛化能力更强，OBB是建模历史文档的关键。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态特征整合和不确定性建模，显著提升了动作识别的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Result: 在多种图像数据集和失真条件下，方法在特征稳定性和水印恢复方面达到最优鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有自监督和深度水印技术。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Accurate, cost-effective monitoring of plantation aboveground biomass (AGB)
is crucial for supporting local livelihoods and carbon sequestration
initiatives like the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) program.
High-resolution canopy height maps (CHMs) are essential for this, but standard
lidar-based methods are expensive. While deep learning with RGB imagery offers
an alternative, accurately extracting canopy height features remains
challenging. To address this, we developed a novel model for high-resolution
CHM generation using a Large Vision Foundation Model (LVFM). Our model
integrates a feature extractor, a self-supervised feature enhancement module to
preserve spatial details, and a height estimator. Tested in Beijing's Fangshan
District using 1-meter Google Earth imagery, our model outperformed existing
methods, including conventional CNNs. It achieved a mean absolute error of 0.09
m, a root mean square error of 0.24 m, and a correlation of 0.78 against
lidar-based CHMs. The resulting CHMs enabled over 90% success in individual
tree detection, high accuracy in AGB estimation, and effective tracking of
plantation growth, demonstrating strong generalization to non-training areas.
This approach presents a promising, scalable tool for evaluating carbon
sequestration in both plantations and natural forests.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 地下矿山中岩石锚杆的频繁评估对维持岩体稳定性至关重要，但传统手动检测方法因环境恶劣且耗时而不切实际，现有自动化技术又因数据噪声和环境复杂性缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DeepBolt方法，采用两阶段深度学习架构，专门处理类别不平衡问题，用于复杂3D点云中的岩石锚杆识别。

Conclusion: DeepBolt在复杂地下环境中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，为岩石锚杆的自动化检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in
underground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock
mass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent
assessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and
minimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of
rock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground
mines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock
bolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the
automatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point
clouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing
techniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature
engineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such
techniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due
to data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.
Moreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale
point clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of
reinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an
approach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning
architecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the
automatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point
clouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
models by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.
Additionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,
achieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,
demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground
environments.

Abstract: Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease causing alveolar bone loss,
significantly affects oral health and quality of life. Accurate assessment of
bone loss severity and pattern is critical for diagnosis and treatment
planning. In this study, we propose a novel AI-based deep learning framework to
automatically detect and quantify alveolar bone loss and its patterns using
intraoral periapical (IOPA) radiographs. Our method combines YOLOv8 for tooth
detection with Keypoint R-CNN models to identify anatomical landmarks, enabling
precise calculation of bone loss severity. Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models
segment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal
vs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated
dataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting
bone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone
loss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a
rapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing
reliance on subjective manual evaluation. By integrating AI into dental
radiographic analysis, our framework has the potential to improve early
diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for periodontitis, ultimately
enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度伪造检测方法忽视压缩引入的块效应和依赖原始图像的问题。

Method: PLADA包含块效应消除器（B2E）和开放数据聚合（ODA）模块，处理压缩图像和未配对数据。

Result: 在26个数据集上实验显示，PLADA优于现有方法，尤其在压缩和有限配对数据场景下。

Conclusion: PLADA为开放世界深度伪造检测提供了稳健解决方案，并首次将块效应作为关键因素。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单帧检测模型忽略视频中的时序信息，而复杂时序模块增加计算负担。

Method: 将连续多帧输入YOLO检测器，仅监督目标帧输出，保留模型轻量化和实时性。

Result: 在MOT20Det和BOAT360数据集上验证，显著提升检测鲁棒性，缩小轻量与重型网络差距。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用时序信息，同时保持模型简洁高效，并贡献了新数据集BOAT360。

Abstract: Modern image-based object detection models, such as YOLOv7, primarily process
individual frames independently, thus ignoring valuable temporal context
naturally present in videos. Meanwhile, existing video-based detection methods
often introduce complex temporal modules, significantly increasing model size
and computational complexity. In practical applications such as surveillance
and autonomous driving, transient challenges including motion blur, occlusions,
and abrupt appearance changes can severely degrade single-frame detection
performance. To address these issues, we propose a straightforward yet highly
effective strategy: stacking multiple consecutive frames as input to a
YOLO-based detector while supervising only the output corresponding to a single
target frame. This approach leverages temporal information with minimal
modifications to existing architectures, preserving simplicity, computational
efficiency, and real-time inference capability. Extensive experiments on the
challenging MOT20Det and our BOAT360 datasets demonstrate that our method
improves detection robustness, especially for lightweight models, effectively
narrowing the gap between compact and heavy detection networks. Additionally,
we contribute the BOAT360 benchmark dataset, comprising annotated fisheye video
sequences captured from a boat, to support future research in multi-frame video
object detection in challenging real-world scenarios.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
segmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range
dependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to
be effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce
semi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.
State-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial
CNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional
neural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a
challenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled
data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to
fully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image
segmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer
lies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to
construct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image
modeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with
masked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels
from labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked
domain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a
theoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and
devise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the
original and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.
We also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive
experiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods
significantly. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/zlheui/AdvMIM.

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions数据集上验证了DaS框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DaS框架通过结合视觉特征和语义信息，成功实现了密集视频字幕生成。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

Abstract: Identifiable causal representation learning seeks to uncover the true causal

presents opportunities to improve the generalisability and robustness of
task-specific latent features. This work introduces the concept of grouping
observations to learn identifiable representations for disease classification
in chest X-rays via an end-to-end framework. Our experiments demonstrate that
these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across
multiple classification tasks when grouping is used to enforce invariance w.r.t

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过分割与总结策略，显著提升了密集视频字幕生成的性能。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Result: 在三个360度数据集上验证，表现优于传统方法和学习基线，具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法适用于实时全向距离估计，尤其适合低成本机器人、自主导航和监控应用。

Abstract: Accurate distance estimation is a fundamental challenge in robotic
perception, particularly in omnidirectional imaging, where traditional
geometric methods struggle with lens distortions and environmental variability.
In this work, we propose a neural network-based approach for monocular distance
estimation using a single 360{\deg} fisheye lens camera. Unlike classical
trigonometric techniques that rely on precise lens calibration, our method
directly learns and infers the distance of objects from raw omnidirectional
inputs, offering greater robustness and adaptability across diverse conditions.
We evaluate our approach on three 360{\deg} datasets (LOAF, ULM360, and a newly
captured dataset Boat360), each representing distinct environmental and sensor
setups. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based
model outperforms traditional geometry-based methods and other learning
baselines in both accuracy and robustness. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning for real-time omnidirectional distance estimation,
making our approach particularly well-suited for low-cost applications in
robotics, autonomous navigation, and surveillance.

Result: 在SUMME和TVSUM数据集上达到最优性能，甚至媲美监督模型。

Conclusion: 展示了高效、无需标注的架构潜力，挑战了对复杂架构的依赖。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of video content and the corresponding demand for
efficient access to meaningful information have elevated video summarization
and video highlights as a vital research area. However, many state-of-the-art
methods depend heavily either on supervised annotations or on attention-based
models, which are computationally expensive and brittle in the face of
distribution shifts that hinder cross-domain applicability across datasets. We
introduce a pioneering self-supervised video summarization model that captures
both spatial and temporal dependencies without the overhead of attention, RNNs,
or transformers. Our framework integrates a novel set of Markov process-driven
loss metrics and a two-stage self supervised learning paradigm that ensures
both performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SUMME and TVSUM datasets, outperforming all existing
unsupervised methods. It also rivals the best supervised models, demonstrating
the potential for efficient, annotation-free architectures. This paves the way
for more generalizable video summarization techniques and challenges the
prevailing reliance on complex architectures.

Result: 实验表明，WonderFree显著提升了渲染质量和全局一致性，用户研究中77.20%的人更偏好WonderFree。

Conclusion: WonderFree通过改进新视角质量和跨视角一致性，实现了无缝且沉浸的3D探索体验。

Abstract: Interactive 3D scene generation from a single image has gained significant
attention due to its potential to create immersive virtual worlds. However, a
key challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,
which cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the
original viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen
areas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that
enables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore
from arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge
into two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts
and floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures
spatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality
in novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration
model designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data
collection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for
WorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D
scene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose
ConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously
restores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering
quality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global
coherence and consistency. These improvements are confirmed by CLIP-based
metrics and a user study showing a 77.20% preference for WonderFree over
WonderWorld enabling a seamless and immersive 3D exploration experience. The
code, model, and data will be publicly available.

Conclusion: SFNet通过多域特征融合有效提升了伪造检测的准确性和泛化能力，为遥感图像伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence is producing fake
remote sensing imagery (RSI) that is increasingly difficult to detect,
potentially leading to erroneous intelligence, fake news, and even conspiracy
theories. Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual
features to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect
forged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to
identify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative
networks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ
depending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within
the RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become
more sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes
existing forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing
data. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,
designed to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging
spatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and
comprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature
extractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs. To
fully utilize the complementary domain features, the domain feature mapping
module and the hybrid domain feature refinement module(CBAM attention) of SFNet
are designed to successively align and fuse the multi-domain features while
suppressing redundant information. Experiments on three datasets show that
SFNet achieves an accuracy improvement of 4%-15.18% over the state-of-the-art
RS forgery detection methods and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: VIPScene为3D场景合成提供了高真实性和一致性的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Traditionally, 3D scene synthesis requires expert knowledge and significant
manual effort. Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as
architectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent
approaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of
large language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation
models. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,
which restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.
Meanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in
viewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present
Video Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework
that exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in
video generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object
placements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and
seamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and
open-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze
each object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism
and structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce
First-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,
utilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning
ability of multimodal large language models. Extensive experiments show that
VIPScene significantly outperforms existing methods and generalizes well across
diverse scenarios. The code will be released.

segmentation to extract object silhouette and interprets semantically
appropriate animal concepts using vision-language models. It then synthesizes
an animal image that conforms to the input shape, leveraging text-to-image
diffusion model and seamlessly blends it into the original scene to generate
visually coherent and spatially consistent compositions. We evaluated
Shape2Animal on a diverse set of real-world inputs, demonstrating its
robustness and creative potential. Our Shape2Animal can offer new opportunities
for visual storytelling, educational content, digital art, and interactive

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态搜索研究提供了实用见解，展示了强化学习在优化搜索行为中的潜力。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

Abstract: Obtaining a better knowledge of the current state and behavior of objects
orbiting Earth has proven to be essential for a range of applications such as
active debris removal, in-orbit maintenance, or anomaly detection. 3D models
represent a valuable source of information in the field of Space Situational
Awareness (SSA). In this work, we leveraged Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
perform 3D reconstruction of non-cooperative space objects from simulated
images. This scenario is challenging for NeRF models due to unusual camera
characteristics and environmental conditions : mono-chromatic images, unknown
object orientation, limited viewing angles, absence of diffuse lighting etc. In
this work we focus primarly on the joint optimization of camera poses alongside
the NeRF. Our experimental results show that the most accurate 3D
reconstruction is achieved when training with successive images one-by-one. We
estimate camera poses by optimizing an uniform rotation and use regularization
to prevent successive poses from being too far apart.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural
networks have demonstrated great performance in this field, interpretability,
an essential requirement for microscopy image analysis, remains an open
challenge.
  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly
learning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as
navigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene
Completion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level
information, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.
While PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images
remain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches
utilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene
volume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during
training, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to
dynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages
context-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address
vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively
initializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image
context and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding
to reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results
show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic
metrics PQ$^\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and
achieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\times$. Furthermore, our ablation
studies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,
as opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a
remarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These
results highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a
pioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.
