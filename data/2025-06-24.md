### [1] [Evaluating Generalization and Representation Stability in Small LMs via Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17289)
*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较小语言模型在少样本提示和监督微调两种适应范式下的泛化能力，分析它们在分布内和分布外设置中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨少样本提示和监督微调在低资源设置和分布偏移下的鲁棒性差异。

Method: 通过任务格式、提示风格和模型规模的比较研究，分析内部表示和特征抽象。

Result: 发现不同适应策略下小模型内化和泛化知识的显著差异。

Conclusion: 为低数据场景下的模型选择提供实用指导，并贡献关于提示与微调辩论的实证见解。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

### [2] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构因果模型（SCM）的个体因果推断（ICI）方法，通过个体化操作符（indiv(W)）和个体因果查询（P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)）来估计个体因果效应（ICE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断方法多为基于群体的，难以直接应用于个体。本文旨在利用SCM中的外生变量（U）编码个体差异，实现个体化的因果推断。

Method: 提出indiv(W)操作符和个体因果查询P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)，通过SCM进行个体化推断。

Result: 论证了ICI是基于个体可能性的推断，而非反事实推断。

Conclusion: SCM为个体因果推断提供了可行的理论框架，扩展了因果推断的应用范围。

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

### [3] [Resource Rational Contractualism Should Guide AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17434)
*Sydney Levine,Matija Franklin,Tan Zhi-Xuan,Secil Yanik Guyot,Lionel Wong,Daniel Kilov,Yejin Choi,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Noah Goodman,Seth Lazar,Iason Gabriel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种资源理性契约主义（RRC）框架，通过启发式方法高效模拟多方协议，使AI系统能动态适应人类社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需在目标与价值观多样的人类环境中决策，传统契约主义达成协议成本高且慢。

Method: 采用资源理性契约主义（RRC），利用规范性启发式方法在效率与准确性间权衡。

Result: RRC框架使AI能高效运作并动态适应人类社会变化。

Conclusion: RRC为AI系统提供了一种高效且适应性强的决策框架。

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

### [4] [Keeping Medical AI Healthy: A Review of Detection and Correction Methods for System Degradation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17442)
*Hao Guan,David Bates,Li Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了医疗AI系统性能退化的原因、检测方法及修正策略，旨在提升其长期部署的可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在现实环境中可能因数据分布变化、患者特征变化等因素导致性能退化，影响其可靠性和安全性，亟需研究如何监测和维护其性能。

Method: 综述了性能退化的常见原因、数据与模型漂移的检测技术、根因分析及修正策略（如模型重训练、测试时适应等）。

Result: 总结了传统机器学习模型与大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗AI中的优劣势，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为开发可靠、稳健的医疗AI系统提供了指导，以应对动态临床环境中的长期部署挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

### [5] [OmniReflect: Discovering Transferable Constitutions for LLM agents via Neuro-Symbolic Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17449)
*Manasa Bharadwaj,Nikhil Verma,Kevin Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniReflect是一个分层、反思驱动的框架，通过构建指导原则（宪法）提升LLM代理的性能，在动态环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如微调和自我修正）缺乏长期学习的通用机制，且在动态环境中效率低下。

Method: OmniReflect采用自我维持和协作两种模式，结合神经、符号和神经符号技术构建宪法。

Result: 在ALFWorld、BabyAI和PDDL等任务中，性能显著提升（绝对增益达10.3%至23.8%）。

Conclusion: OmniReflect展示了跨环境和模型的高效性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

### [6] [From Unstructured Communication to Intelligent RAG: Multi-Agent Automation for Supply Chain Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17484)
*Yao Zhang,Zaixi Shang,Silpan Patel,Mikel Zuniga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体系统，将供应链支持票据等非结构化通信转化为结构化知识库，显著提升RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链操作中大量关键知识隐藏在非结构化通信中，现有RAG系统因数据噪声和不完整性效果有限，需要一种离线优先的方法来优化知识管理。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（分类发现、分类和知识合成）将支持票据转化为结构化知识库，减少数据量并提升质量。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著优于传统RAG（48.74% vs. 38.60%有用回答），减少77.4%无用响应，并能自动解决50%未来票据。

Conclusion: 通过离线处理将非结构化通信转化为结构化知识，显著提升供应链操作效率，填补了知识管理的关键空白。

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

### [7] [Kaleidoscopic Teaming in Multi Agent Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17514)
*Ninareh Mehrabi,Tharindu Kumarage,Kai-Wei Chang,Aram Galstyan,Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为"万花筒式团队"的新框架，用于评估AI代理在单代理和多代理场景中的安全性，弥补现有方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队或安全评估框架无法充分评估AI代理在复杂行为和交互中的安全风险，尤其是在多代理场景中。

Method: 引入"万花筒式团队"框架，生成多样化场景模拟现实社会，评估单代理和多代理的安全性，并采用新的上下文优化技术生成更优场景。

Result: 通过该框架，识别了多种模型在代理应用中的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: "万花筒式团队"框架为AI代理的安全性评估提供了更全面的方法，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

### [8] [Cite Pretrain: Retrieval-Free Knowledge Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17585)
*Yukun Huang,Sanxing Chen,Jian Pei,Manzil Zaheer,Bhuwan Dhingra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨如何通过改进训练过程使语言模型能可靠地引用预训练文档，而无需依赖实时检索。提出Active Indexing方法，显著提升引用精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的引用不可靠，依赖外部检索器会引入延迟和噪声。研究目标是让模型在预训练阶段就能可靠引用文档。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 持续预训练将事实与文档标识符绑定；2) 指令调优激发引用行为。提出Active Indexing，通过合成QA对增强训练数据。

Result: Active Indexing在Qwen2.5-7B和3B上表现优于Passive Indexing，引用精度提升高达30.2%。数据量增加时性能持续提升。

Conclusion: Active Indexing能有效提升语言模型的引用可靠性，且性能随数据量增加而提升。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

### [9] [Taming the Untamed: Graph-Based Knowledge Retrieval and Reasoning for MLLMs to Conquer the Unknown](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17589)
*Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过构建多模态知识图谱（MH-MMKG）和设计多代理检索器，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在罕见领域任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但在罕见领域任务中因相关知识有限而表现不佳。

Method: 采用视觉游戏认知作为测试平台，构建多模态知识图谱（MH-MMKG），并设计多代理检索器以自主搜索相关知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: 为多模态知识增强推理提供了新视角，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在CTF竞赛中的表现，提出了CTFKnow基准和CTFAgent框架，显著提升了LLMs的解题能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在CTF竞赛中的自动化解题能力，填补其在技术知识应用和适应性上的不足。

Method: 构建CTFKnow基准（3,992题）评估LLMs，提出CTFAgent框架，包含两阶段RAG和环境增强模块。

Result: CTFAgent在实验中性能提升80%，并在picoCTF2024中排名前23.6%。

Conclusion: CTFAgent框架有效提升了LLMs在CTF中的表现，展示了其在网络安全教育中的潜力。

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

TL;DR: PhysUniBench是一个多模态基准测试，用于评估和改进多模态大语言模型在本科物理问题上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法在捕捉本科物理的广度和复杂性方面存在局限，需要更严格的评估工具。

Method: 通过多阶段构建过程，包括专家评估、自动筛选和难度分级，创建了包含3,304个物理问题的基准测试。

Result: 当前最先进模型在物理推理上表现不佳，例如GPT-4o mini的准确率仅为34.2%。

Conclusion: PhysUniBench旨在推动AI在科学领域的发展，促进模型在物理推理和多模态理解上的进步。

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

### [12] [Beyond Syntax: Action Semantics Learning for App Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17697)
*Bohan Tang,Dezhao Luo,Jingxuan Chen,Shaogang Gong,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASL的新学习框架，通过捕捉动作语义而非语法形式，提升App代理的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的解决方案依赖昂贵的封闭LLM API，而微调开源LLM的方法因语法学习范式导致OOD脆弱性。

Method: 提出ASL框架，定义动作语义为界面状态转换，并设计SEE计算语义奖励以训练代理。

Result: 理论证明ASL对OOD问题更具鲁棒性，实验显示其在智能手机App操作基准上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASL通过语义学习解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了App代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

Conclusion: 序列结构框架为多智能体协作提供了更灵活和高效的通信方式。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

Method: 采用混合推理框架，将信念推断外化为结构化概率模型，同时利用LLM处理语言理解和交互。

Result: 该方法在Agent-Agent对抗中表现优异，首次以67%胜率击败人类玩家，并获得更高评价。

Conclusion: 混合推理框架有效提升了语言模型的社交推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

Method: 通过动态细化MDP并迭代选择最脆弱区域进行优化，平衡准确性与效率。

Result: 在多达1M状态的MDP案例中，性能比PRISM提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模MDP的策略合成提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

### [16] [Reflective Verbal Reward Design for Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17834)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson,Edith Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化奖励建模方法，通过对话引导用户反思和构建偏好，解决了传统RLHF方法中少数群体偏好被压制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类价值观具有多样性，传统RLHF方法通过单一奖励模型聚合反馈可能压制少数群体偏好。

Method: 使用语言模型引导用户通过反思对话构建个性化偏好，并基于对话历史生成个性化奖励模型。

Result: 在30名参与者的研究中，该方法比非反思性方法准确率提高9-12%，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 个性化奖励建模方法能更准确地反映用户偏好，同时提升样本效率。

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将形式最优控制理论作为AI对齐研究的核心，提出了一种分层对齐控制框架，以增强对前沿AI模型和代理系统的控制潜力与限制的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全和机制可解释性研究在形式上虽有所进展，但缺乏普适性和协议互操作性，需要更全面的控制框架。

Method: 通过形式最优控制原则重新定义对齐，并引入分层对齐控制栈，明确各层的测量与控制特性及其互操作性。

Result: 提出了Alignment Control Stack，为政府和监管机构提供了必要的保证，以促进AI技术的可持续发展。

Conclusion: 结合最优控制理论与实际部署考虑，构建更全面的对齐框架，提升高级AI系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体系统的自动化事实核查方法，显著提升了准确性、效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字时代中错误信息的快速传播对公共讨论构成挑战，传统人工核查方法难以应对在线内容的规模和速度。

Method: 设计了一个包含四个专门智能体的系统：输入分解、查询生成、证据检索和裁决预测。

Result: 在基准数据集上，Macro F1分数比基线方法提高了12.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化事实核查提供了更准确、高效且透明的解决方案，同时保持实际应用的扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI系统规模和复杂度的增加，日志数据变得海量、非结构化且语义模糊，传统方法难以有效定位故障和实现自修复。

Method: 扩展预训练Transformer模型，结合多阶段语义推理机制，动态结构化日志，使用无监督聚类和嵌入提取事件模板，通过微调LLM和多轮注意力机制生成故障假设和根因路径，并引入基于强化学习的恢复规划器。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-ID在云平台日志数据集上故障定位准确率提升16.2%，优于主流方法。

Conclusion: LLM-ID具有更强的语义理解、持续学习和异构环境适应能力，为复杂系统的故障定位和自修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

Result: CogniGUI在现有和新提出的基准测试中均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: CogniGUI通过自适应学习和复杂交互评估，显著提升了GUI代理的性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

Motivation: 挑战传统提示设计，探索更高效的提示优化方法。

Method: 提出PromptQuine框架，通过进化搜索自动寻找修剪策略。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优于现有方法，且运行时效率良好。

Conclusion: 为上下文学习机制研究提供新方向，呼吁开发更开放的搜索算法。

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Conclusion: 尽管存在剂量编码和实时更新等限制，medicX-KG为药剂师提供了实用工具，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

Method: 通过定义BC+的语义基于命题公式的一般稳定模型语义，将现代ASP语言构造视为命题公式的简写。

Result: BC+能够涵盖其他动作语言（如B、C、C+、BC）的最佳特性，并可通过ASP求解器实现。

Conclusion: BC+是一种表达能力强的动作语言，填补了现有技术的空白，并已通过扩展cplus2asp系统实现。

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

Result: SE-Merging显著提升性能，且无需额外训练，与现有技术兼容。

Conclusion: 模型合并通过区分任务和适应专家模型实现多任务能力，SE-Merging进一步优化了这一过程。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

Result: 用户研究证明了CoachGPT的实用性和LLM在学术写作中的潜力。

Conclusion: CoachGPT通过独特的脚手架结构，为学术写作提供了更沉浸式的体验，展示了LLM在教育领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否具有人类认知特征，以提升AI透明度和伦理部署。

Method: 评估多个专有和开源模型，使用结构化提示和自动评分。

Result: 模型能生成连贯叙述，易受正面框架影响，道德判断偏向自由/压迫，并表现出自我矛盾但合理化。

Conclusion: 研究为AI透明度和伦理部署提供启示，并建议未来结合认知心理学与AI安全。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

### [31] [Chain-of-Memory: Enhancing GUI Agents for Cross-Application Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18158)
*Xinzge Gao,Chuanrui Hu,Bin Chen,Teng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Memory (CoM)的新方法，用于显式建模GUI代理的短期和长期记忆，以解决现有方法在复杂跨应用任务中无法有效存储关键信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理方法依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，导致任务状态理解不准确，缺乏有效机制存储复杂任务中的关键信息。

Method: CoM通过捕获动作描述、整合任务相关屏幕信息，并维护专用内存模块来显式建模记忆。

Result: 实验表明，CoM显著提升了GUI代理在跨应用任务中的性能，并使7B模型具备与72B模型相当的内存管理能力。

Conclusion: CoM通过显式记忆表示提升了GUI代理的任务状态理解和历史信息保留能力，相关数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

*Zhiting Mei,Christina Zhang,Tenny Yin,Justin Lidard,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过于自信，尤其是错误回答时，而深度推理可能加剧这一问题。通过自省式不确定性量化（UQ），部分模型校准得到改善，但效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在生成自信但错误的回答（幻觉）时存在风险，需量化其不确定性以确保安全部署。

Method: 提出自省式不确定性量化（UQ），评估模型校准情况，并测试深度推理和自省对校准的影响。

Result: 发现推理模型普遍过于自信，深度推理加剧此问题；自省UQ对部分模型（如o3-Mini、DeepSeek R1）有效，但对其他模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）无效。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究设计UQ基准和改进推理模型的校准方法。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Pim Welle,Jeremy C. Weiss,George H. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究量化了精神分裂症患者不坚持服用抗精神病药物与不良后果的关联，使用生存分析和因果推断方法，发现不坚持服药会使不良后果提前1至4个月。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨精神分裂症患者不坚持服药对不良后果的影响，为临床和政策提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，结合T-learner、S-learner和最近邻匹配等因果推断方法，利用不同时间段的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）。

Result: 不坚持服药显著提前不良后果1至4个月，且不同药物类型和剂型的结果一致。

Conclusion: 坚持服药对延缓精神危机至关重要，生存分析与因果推断结合可提供政策相关见解，但需注意因果解释的假设。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Method: 提出一个结构化的描述性框架，系统化分析现有评估方法和术语，不引入新分类或固定格式。

Result: 框架支持评估的透明度、可比性和可解释性，帮助识别方法缺陷、设计评估工具，并为政策制定者提供参考。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI能力评估提供了实用的分析工具，适用于研究者、实践者和政策制定者。

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and
transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance,
informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

TL;DR: 本文探索了虚拟逻辑深度（VLD）作为模型扩展的第四维度，发现其能显著提升推理能力，同时保持知识容量几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究参数重用在模型扩展中的潜力及其特性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的对照实验，分析VLD扩展对模型知识容量和推理能力的影响。

Result: VLD扩展在保持知识容量几乎不变的同时，显著提升了推理能力；参数数量与知识容量相关，但与推理能力无关。

Conclusion: VLD扩展是一种有效的模型扩展方法，可在不增加参数的情况下提升推理能力。

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

work highlights the potential of agentic frameworks to systematically explore

Future directions include incorporating planning mechanisms and optimizing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM科学家代理缺乏交互式推理和评估机制，难以模拟真实科研协作。

Method: 提出IDVSCI框架，包含动态知识交换和双多样性评审机制。

Result: 在计算机科学和健康科学数据集上表现优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 模拟交互和同行评审动态对LLM自主研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，用于从学术论文中提取模拟电路的尺寸关系，有效剪枝搜索空间，提升优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在模拟电路预布局阶段的器件尺寸设计中，忽略了先验知识的自动引入，导致搜索空间压缩不足，优化效率低下。

Method: 采用LLM多智能体框架，从论文中提取尺寸关系，并基于此剪枝搜索空间。

Result: 在3类电路上测试，优化效率提升2.32至26.6倍。

Conclusion: LLM能有效剪枝模拟电路尺寸设计的搜索空间，为LLM与传统模拟电路设计自动化方法的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

*Feng He,Zhenyang Liu,Marco Valentino,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，模型编辑后的行为在微调过程中通常无法持久，即使微调与编辑无关。DoRA微调方法表现出最强的编辑反转效果，而UCE编辑方法相对更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究模型编辑与微调之间的相互作用，以解决编辑行为是否会在微调后失效的问题，这对AI安全和实际应用具有重要意义。

Method: 在T2I扩散模型（Stable Diffusion和FLUX）中，结合两种编辑技术（UCE和ReFACT）和三种微调方法（DreamBooth、LoRA、DoRA），通过多样化的编辑任务和评估指标进行实证分析。

Result: 编辑行为在微调后普遍失效，DoRA对编辑的反转效果最强，而UCE编辑方法在微调后保留的效果优于ReFACT。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法存在局限性，需开发更稳健的技术以确保AI系统的长期可控性和对齐性，同时微调可作为恶意编辑的补救手段，但需重新编辑以维持安全性和对齐性。

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

Motivation: 医疗器械合规性中标准适用性判断依赖专家解读，文档分散且异构，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）管道，结合大语言模型，从自由文本设备描述中推断标准适用性（强制、推荐或不适用）。

Result: 系统在分类准确率和检索召回率上优于基线方法，支持跨辖区（如中美）标准推理。

Conclusion: 该系统为监管科学提供了可扩展且可解释的AI支持，首次实现端到端的标准适用性推理。

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However,
existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

Result: 实验表明T-CPDL显著提高了推理准确性、可解释性和置信度校准。

Conclusion: T-CPDL增强了语言模型的决策能力，为Logic-RAG框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Conclusion: Airalogy有望加速科学创新，惠及全球研究社区。

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Programming by Backprop (PBB)方法，通过仅训练源代码（无I/O示例）提升大语言模型（LLMs）的泛化推理能力，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs通过源代码训练提升泛化推理能力的机制，尤其是无I/O示例时的表现。

Method: 通过两组程序（带I/O示例和不带I/O示例）微调LLMs，比较其表现。

Result: 发现LLMs能通过源代码隐式评估程序，且PBB方法比传统I/O训练更稳健。

Conclusion: 代码训练使LLMs内化可重用算法抽象，未来可进一步优化符号过程学习。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出ConciseHint框架，通过在推理过程中注入文本提示，鼓励模型生成简洁的推理过程，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但推理过程冗长导致效率问题。现有方法忽略在生成过程中直接干预的潜力。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在推理过程中动态注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并根据查询复杂度自适应调整提示强度。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen-3等模型上实验，推理长度减少65%（GSM8K基准），且几乎无准确率损失。

Conclusion: ConciseHint能有效生成简洁推理过程，同时保持模型性能，为提升推理效率提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过激活语言模型的潜在子空间来引导科学代码生成偏向特定编程语言，以解决现有方法的局限性和泛化性问题。

Method: 开发了梯度优化的自适应激活框架（G-ACT），通过聚类每提示激活差异并训练轻量级层探针，选择适当的引导向量。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2 3B模型中，G-ACT显著提高了CPP语言的生成偏向性，探针分类准确率提升15%，早期层准确率提升61.5%。

Conclusion: G-ACT提供了一种可扩展、可解释且高效的机制，适用于实际代理系统的概念级控制。

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

Motivation: 解决传统机器学习方法在求解多尺度和多输入PDE时泛化能力不足和计算成本高的问题。

Method: MMET框架通过解耦网格和查询点序列、引入GCE层嵌入多尺度输入，并采用Hilbert曲线和补丁嵌入机制减少输入长度。

Conclusion: MMET为工程和物理应用中的实时PDE求解提供了可扩展的解决方案，并为特定领域的大规模预训练模型探索铺平了道路。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

Motivation: 现有基于视觉变换器（ViT）的无监督域适应方法在跨域注意力一致性上存在局限，尤其是前景对象大小和空间分布不一致的问题。

Method: 提出PCaM机制，逐步过滤背景信息，并引入注意力引导损失以增强任务相关区域的注意力一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，PCaM显著提升了域适应性能，并达到了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景语义融合，有效解决了跨域前景不匹配问题，提升了域适应效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种高效的开源解决方案，显著优化了时序驱动的全局布局性能。

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Conclusion: LSMI能够支持冗余信息样本划分、目标知识蒸馏和交互感知模型集成等实际应用。

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有早期退出方法仅依赖类相关logits，忽略了类无关信息对预测确定性的负面影响，导致预测确定性高估和错误退出。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，平均加速比达2.19倍，性能损失可忽略，优于现有方法ConsistentEE 28%。

Conclusion: CAP方法通过更全面的预测确定性估计，实现了任务性能与推理效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有稀疏攻击方法在解释深度神经网络（DNN）的脆弱性时存在稀疏性差、计算开销大、迁移性弱和攻击强度不足的问题。

Method: 引入了一种理论支持的参数化技术近似NP难的l0优化问题，并设计了新的损失函数以同时最大化对抗性和最小化扰动像素数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在计算开销、迁移性和攻击强度上优于现有稀疏攻击方法，并能生成更稀疏的对抗样本。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为评估DNN鲁棒性提供了基准，还揭示了两种噪声类型（“遮蔽噪声”和“引导噪声”），有助于解释对抗扰动如何误导分类器。

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited

utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SamS的动态样本调度算法，用于优化DPO过程中样本的选择，以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO的性能依赖于人类偏好数据的质量，但现有方法忽略了模型状态的变化对数据选择的影响。

Method: 提出SamS算法，动态调度训练样本，基于模型的学习反馈自适应选择样本。

Result: 在不修改DPO核心算法的情况下，SamS显著提升了任务性能，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SamS为通过更有效利用固定偏好数据集改进LLM对齐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

Conclusion: 卷积网络能有效捕捉复杂时间模式，为未来研究提供了新方向。

(SOTA) results in long-term time series prediction. Our findings highlight the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新的大型语言模型快速涌现，服务提供商需要在有限的部署容量和成本预算下管理不断变化的模型库存。

Method: StageRoute通过乐观选择模型（使用奖励上界和成本下界）和预算约束的bandit子问题路由查询。

Result: 理论证明StageRoute的遗憾度为$T^{2/3}$，实验表明其接近最优性能。

Conclusion: StageRoute在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于LLM服务管理。

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速增长超过了边缘设备的存储限制，需要超越1比特极限的极端权重压缩。

Method: 采用数据素描技术，结合低估AbsMaxMin素描、重要性感知空间分配和直通估计器进行压缩感知微调。

Result: 在Llama-3.2-1B上实现0.5比特压缩，同时保持竞争力困惑度和可容忍的延迟开销。

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM为资源受限环境中部署LLMs提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 青光眼视野缺损模式的预测通常仅基于形态学，本研究旨在探索生物力学特征的附加价值。

Method: 237名青光眼患者参与，通过眼压升高实验获取ONH应变数据，结合几何深度学习模型进行分类预测。

Result: 模型AUC达0.77-0.88，ONH应变显著提升预测性能，下部和下颞侧缘是关键区域。

Conclusion: ONH应变增强青光眼视野缺损预测，神经视网膜缘是最关键区域。

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

Motivation: 资源限制（如内存）可能改变学习和决策过程，研究内存分配对智能体性能的影响。

Method: 在MCTS和DQN算法中研究内存分配，分析其在片段学习和持续学习中的表现。

Result: 不同内存分配策略对智能体性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 内存分配是优化智能体性能的关键因素，需在模型估计和规划之间权衡。

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

Conclusion: 优化感知的重述是一种可重用且低开销的增强方法，适用于零阶优化微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的遗忘攻击方法（SUA），通过生成通用噪声模式恢复被遗忘的敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLM可能记忆敏感信息，现有遗忘方法无法确保信息被真正遗忘，因此需要验证遗忘效果并研究潜在攻击。

Method: 提出SUA框架，学习通用噪声模式，通过嵌入对齐损失提高攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 实验证明SUA能有效恢复被遗忘信息，且噪声模式具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 知识重现是MLLM遗忘后的普遍行为，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在细粒度判别和深度因果推理任务中存在局限，主要依赖表面统计相关性，缺乏捕捉视觉与文本内容间潜在因果逻辑的能力。

Method: 提出CF-VLM框架，通过三种互补的训练目标：保持跨模态对齐基础、强化事实场景表示的唯一性和稳定性、提升模型对关键因果编辑的敏感性。

Result: CF-VLM在组合推理和泛化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，并显示出减少视觉幻觉的潜力，提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: CF-VLM为需要可靠推理和可解释性的高风险现实场景提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决自动化算法选择问题，提供理论支持并实现实际部署。

Method: 通过Comb Operator（包括sigmoid门控选择器和N-Path Comb）学习算法间的插值，并结合自适应种子函数。

Result: 在20×20问题-算法研究中实现99.9%+的准确率，样本需求少且收敛快。

Conclusion: AlgoSelect为自动化算法选择提供了理论支持，具有普适性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的特征空间知识，但其性能在非鲁棒骨干网络（如ViT-B/16）上显著下降，需要补充数据集特定知识。

Method: 通过并行分支学习输入空间知识，结合贪婪文本集成和细化增强文本特征，并通过域感知提示逐步融合文本与视觉特征。

Result: 在5个大规模基准测试（WILDS和DomainNet）上表现优异，ViT-B/16网络在iWildCam和FMoW上分别提升5.1 F1和3.1% WC Acc。

Conclusion: 直接学习输入空间知识能有效补充CLIP的通用能力，提升少样本测试时域适应任务的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

TL;DR: AutomataGPT是一种基于Transformer的模型，通过预训练模拟轨迹数据，能够高效预测和推断细胞自动机的局部更新规则，展示了在科学发现中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从数据中自动发现细胞自动机的局部更新规则，并用于定量预测，解决传统方法的挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的Transformer模型（AutomataGPT），基于100种二维二进制确定性细胞自动机规则的模拟轨迹数据进行训练。

Result: 模型在新规则上实现98.5%的一步预测准确率，规则推断功能准确率达96%，规则矩阵匹配率达82%。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练在细胞自动机规则空间中的广泛区域显著提升了模型的泛化能力，为科学发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 社交元宇宙中隐私保护和高质量低延迟流媒体的需求是主要挑战。

Method: 提出ASMS系统，基于F-MAPPO（联邦多智能体近端策略优化），结合联邦学习和深度强化学习。

Result: 实验显示ASMS在各种网络条件下比现有方法提升用户体验至少14%。

Conclusion: ASMS在动态和资源受限网络中提供无缝沉浸式流媒体，同时确保用户数据本地化。

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Motivation: 地下氢存储（UHS）是低碳经济转型中的重要能源存储方式，快速模拟氢羽流迁移和压力场演化对UHS管理至关重要。

Method: 通过参数化实验相对渗透率曲线，并将其作为关键不确定性参数纳入FFINO模型，同时与FMIONet模型进行多指标对比。

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型的独特架构引入了未被充分探索的安全对齐挑战，现有策略不适用于MoE特有的漏洞。

Method: 提出了SAFEx框架，使用SES算法识别和验证安全关键专家模块，并将其分解为不同功能组。

Result: 实验表明，主流MoE模型的安全性依赖于少数专家模块，禁用这些模块会显著降低模型拒绝有害请求的能力。

Conclusion: MoE模型的安全性高度依赖特定专家模块，SAFEx框架为理解和改进MoE模型的安全对齐提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理时计算技术（如自我验证和自校正）是否适用于视觉语言模型（VLM），尤其是RL训练的模型。

Method: 通过解码策略（如多数投票和最佳选择）和自我验证方法，评估VLM的推理性能提升效果。

Result: 生成依赖方法（如多数投票）比验证依赖方法（如最佳选择）提升更显著；RL训练的VLM缺乏跨模态自我验证能力。

Conclusion: RL训练的VLM在推理时计算技术中表现有限，主要因缺乏跨模态自我验证能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Motivation: 联邦学习在可解释性和隐私保护方面存在挑战，需要一种既能保持模型性能又能提升解释性的方法。

Method: 采用神经加法模型（NAMs）与联邦学习结合，形成FedNAMs，通过分散训练和特征专注学习提升隐私和解释性。

Conclusion: FedNAMs在隐私保护、模型效率和解释性方面表现出色，适用于金融和医疗等领域。

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Conclusion: 结合推理时微调与元学习的度量模型能有效适应小样本任务，避免过拟合，提升分类性能。

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的训练策略LGT，用于解决深度图卷积网络（GCNs）中的过平滑问题，通过逐步训练和优化方法显著提升了深层网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要将GCNs的过平滑问题归因于图拉普拉斯算子的重复应用，但作者发现可训练的线性变换会加剧特征崩溃，而完全移除这些变换又会削弱模型的表达能力。

Method: 提出了Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT)策略，包含分层训练、低秩适应和恒等初始化三个组件，以逐步构建深层GCNs并保持其表达能力。

Result: 实验表明，LGT在32层GCNs中实现了最先进的性能，并能与现有方法（如PairNorm和ContraNorm）无缝结合，进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: LGT为可扩展的深层GCNs提供了一个通用的、与架构无关的训练框架。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize

challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EQuARX的动态块级量化AllReduce方法，用于优化TPU上的LLM部署，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的部署面临设备间通信（collectives）带来的性能开销问题，直接量化这些通信操作存在数值不稳定性和误差累积的挑战。

Method: 在XLA编译器中为TPU设计了一种原生动态块级高效量化AllReduce（EQuARX），结合TPU友好的量化和通信与计算的深度流水线技术。

Result: 使用int8精度的EQuARX比基线BF16 AllReduce快1.8倍，并在Gemma 3 27B和12B模型的预填充阶段分别实现了1.25倍和1.1倍的加速，且对质量影响极小。

Conclusion: EQuARX通过高效的量化技术显著提升了LLM在TPU上的部署效率，同时保持了模型质量。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要有效的预防策略，现有模型依赖医学测试数据且解释性不足，限制了其主动自我评估的实用性。

Method: 开发深度学习模型，利用个人和生活方式因素预测13种慢性疾病风险，并通过SHAP解释性验证特征与医学文献的一致性。

Result: 模型的最重要特征与医学文献高度一致，表明该方法在慢性疾病预测中具有广泛可信度。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的自我预防工具奠定了基础，未来可探索其他增强模型可信度的方法及伦理使用问题。

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在现实环境中的广泛应用，动态深度学习系统（DDLSs）通过输入自适应计算优化效率，但其动态特性带来了潜在的安全风险，尤其是效率漏洞可能被攻击者利用。

Result: 揭示了当前系统暴露的效率漏洞，并提出了在对抗条件下保持鲁棒性的防御方法。

Conclusion: 动态深度学习系统的安全风险需要更多关注，针对性防御措施可以有效提升其对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的时间序列预测方法缺乏统一的文本提示范式和模态差异处理。

Method: 提出LLM-Prompt框架，包含统一的文本提示范式（软提示和硬提示）和跨模态语义对齐模块。

Result: 在6个公共数据集和3个碳排放数据集上验证了LLM-Prompt的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt是一个强大的时间序列预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Method: 提出了一个上下文多臂老虎机框架，开发了基于LinUCB的算法，支持预算和位置感知的扩展。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和成本效率上优于现有LLM路由策略。

Conclusion: 上下文多臂老虎机框架为实时、自适应的LLM选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

Motivation: 传统模型（如RUM）假设线性关系，无法捕捉非线性交互和司机个性化偏好，影响预测准确性。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，模型能准确预测司机效用，平衡可解释性和不确定性量化，并揭示司机偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了预测准确性，为网约车系统优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）因依赖外部数据集训练，可能导致特征不稳定和虚假特征（Fake Features），无法准确捕捉模型内部特征。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE方法，利用模型自身生成的合成数据集训练SAE，减少外部数据带来的分布外（OOD）问题。

Result: FaithfulSAE在5/7的模型中表现出更低的虚假特征比例，并在SAE探测任务中优于基于网络数据训练的SAE。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE消除了对外部数据集的依赖，提升了模型内部特征的捕捉能力，强调了SAE训练数据集的重要性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GNNs在部署中的脆弱性，同时为低资源研究环境提供了一种高效且伦理的GNN获取方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PhysiX，首个用于物理模拟的大规模基础模型，通过自回归生成和离散化方法解决了数据稀缺问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟领域缺乏大规模数据集，限制了基础模型的应用，导致现有模型难以进行长程预测和多任务训练。

Method: PhysiX是一个4.5B参数的自回归生成模型，使用离散化编码和自回归预测目标，并引入细化模块减少离散化误差。

Result: PhysiX在实验中优于任务特定基线，并在The Well基准测试中达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: PhysiX成功解决了数据瓶颈，证明了从自然视频中学习知识可迁移到物理模拟，多任务训练能促进协同学习。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将机器学习模型输出与PyReason框架结合的方法，以实现复杂工作流中的实时自适应决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型输出难以转化为复杂工作流中可操作的推理决策的问题。

Method: 通过PyReason框架，将ML模型的实值输出（如概率、置信度）转换为逻辑事实，并动态计算最小模型。

Result: 实现了实时自适应决策，支持时间敏感数据分析和组织知识整合。

Conclusion: 结合ML的感知能力和PyReason的逻辑推理，为复杂流程自动化提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

TL;DR: UIExplore-Bench是首个专注于UI探索的基准测试，评估代理在结构化模式和屏幕模式下的表现，提出hUFO指标量化探索效果。UIExplore-AlGo表现最佳，但仍与人类专家存在差距。

Motivation: 缺乏对UI探索阶段的系统评估，需要标准化基准测试以推动研究。

Method: 在GitLab沙盒环境中，通过结构化模式（访问DOM树）或屏幕模式（依赖GUI观察）评估代理，提出hUFO指标。

Result: UIExplore-AlGo在结构化模式和屏幕模式下的hUFO得分分别为77.2%和59.0%，但仍显著低于人类表现。

Conclusion: UIExplore-Bench为UI探索研究提供了标准化工具，显示当前代理性能与人类存在差距，未来有改进空间。

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

Motivation: 现有指令调节方法在低容量模型中存在表示限制，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE)块，结合Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL)训练任务专用参数。

Result: MoTE在检索数据集上性能提升64%，所有数据集上提升43%，且不改变指令、数据或推理时间。

Conclusion: MoTE有效解决了低容量模型的表示限制，显著提升了嵌入性能。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

*Amber Hu,Henry Smith,Scott Linderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SING的新方法，利用自然梯度变分推断（VI）高效处理潜在随机微分方程（SDE）模型中的推理问题，解决了现有方法的收敛慢和数值不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在SDE模型在复杂领域中应用广泛，但精确的后验推理通常难以实现，现有变分推断方法存在收敛慢和不稳定的问题。

Method: SING通过自然梯度VI利用模型和变分后验的几何结构，近似难解积分并并行化时间计算，实现快速可靠的推理。

Result: SING在状态推理和漂移函数估计上优于现有方法，并在神经动力学建模等应用中表现出色。

Conclusion: SING为复杂动态系统提供了一种准确的推理工具，特别适用于先验知识有限和非共轭结构的场景。

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Motivation: 传统神经网络适应新任务需要任务特定的微调和标注数据，耗时且依赖性强。

Method: 使用扩散模型学习任务特定参数空间的结构，并直接根据任务标识生成参数。

Result: 扩散模型能生成准确的任务特定参数，支持多任务插值，但无法泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了生成解决方案的潜力，但也揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线更稳健地估计泛化差距。

Conclusion: 提出的平坦度度量方法能有效评估泛化能力，尤其适用于非过度自信的模型。

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

Motivation: 探索批大小在图和文本领域中对泛化的因果机制，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出HGCNet，利用深度结构因果模型（DSCMs）和超图捕捉高阶交互，通过do-calculus量化批大小的直接和间接效应。

Result: HGCNet在多个数据集上优于基线模型，发现小批大小通过随机性和平坦最小值提升泛化。

Conclusion: HGCNet为深度学习训练策略提供了可解释的因果见解，推动优化和架构选择的科学性。

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（如RLHF和DPO）需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或不适用于无法访问模型权重的情况。测试时方法虽绕过权重更新，但成本高且依赖不完美的奖励函数。

Method: IRO通过迭代采样、重采样和训练轻量级价值函数，利用搜索优化过程在测试时引导基础模型生成。

Result: IRO能够在无需访问模型权重的情况下对齐模型，类似于OpenAI的RFT，但更灵活。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种高效且灵活的对齐方法，适用于测试时优化和用户自定义数据集。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于基线，提升预测准确性、鲁棒性和校准性，支持影响力模式和社交模糊性分析。

Conclusion: 提出统一因果几何方法，适用于动态社交环境中的不确定性学习。

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

Conclusion: 合成数据生成器在低数据量下表现良好，SDV因其易用性更适合实际应用。

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: 研究为上下文学习提供了基于策略损失与复杂度权衡的解释性和预测性理论。

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Conclusion: NestQuant是一种高效的资源适应方法，适用于物联网设备上的量化模型部署。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

### [118] [Choice of Scoring Rules for Indirect Elicitation of Properties with Parametric Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17880)
*Lingfang Hu,Ian A. Kash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了间接引发统计属性的评分规则选择问题，通过参数化假设和权重配置优化目标属性的估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何选择适当的评分规则以优化目标属性的估计，填补了现有文献在应用中选择评分规则的空白。

Method: 通过模拟研究和理论分析，探讨权重配置对目标属性估计的影响，并建立理论框架解释实验结果。

Result: 发现最优权重配置通常将部分权重设为零，且在二维和高维情况下均能通过理论解释实验结果。

Conclusion: 参数化假设下的间接引发方法能有效优化目标属性估计，理论框架支持实验结果并为更复杂情况提供指导。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于芯片制造中第三方工具和设计的使用增加，硬件木马的威胁日益严重，现有基于图神经网络的方法在大型设计上表现不佳。

Method: 开发了一个生成大型设计图嵌入的框架，结合多种GNN模型，并引入模型量化技术以提高训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在大型芯片设计中高效且有效地检测硬件木马，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线强化学习竞价方法（ORLB）受限于数据集的状态覆盖范围，而基于模拟器的强化学习（SRLB）存在模拟与现实的差距问题。因此，需要一种能结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出了MRLB方法，通过从真实数据中学习环境模型，并结合真实与模型生成数据训练策略。进一步设计了PE-MORL算法，包括置换等变模型架构和鲁棒的离线Q学习方法。

Result: 实验表明，PE-MORL在真实场景中优于现有自动竞价方法。

Conclusion: MRLB和PE-MORL有效解决了ORLB和SRLB的局限性，为自动竞价提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应时空早期决策模型（ASTER），将预测与决策直接结合，优化资源分配和干预策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在时空预测的及时性和准确性上有所提升，但将预测转化为可操作的决策仍具挑战性，尤其是在紧急响应等场景中。

Method: ASTER设计了资源感知时空交互模块（RaST）和基于多目标强化学习的偏好导向决策代理（Poda），直接生成可操作的决策。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，ASTER在早期预测准确性和资源分配效果上均达到领先水平。

Conclusion: ASTER通过将预测与决策直接结合，显著提升了时空智能在决策支持中的实际效果。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型成本高昂且过度自信，需要一种更高效、低成本且可靠的学习框架。

Method: 基于总概率定律的非平衡熵优化玻尔兹曼机框架，无需梯度下降，具有数学证明的存在性和唯一性标准。

Result: 在合成问题和气候预测中，该方法性能优越且模型更简洁，气候数据训练需求远低于现有工具。

Conclusion: 新框架在性能和成本上均优于现有AI工具，特别适用于资源有限的应用场景。

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

Result: UNIVERSE在单一检查点下达到与任务专用基线相当的性能，并通过人类研究验证了其与人类判断的一致性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE是一种可扩展、语义感知的世界模型评估工具。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

Result: h-calibration克服了现有方法的局限性，在标准基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 研究为学习可靠概率提供了理论框架和实践方法，具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

Conclusion: SliceGX为GNN提供了分层解释能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

Motivation: 探讨未经处理的文本嵌入对模型性能的影响，揭示模型崩溃现象及其对下游任务的潜在危害。

Method: 比较相同超参数配置下在原始表格数据及其TE对应数据上训练的模型，提出衡量模型崩溃程度的指标。

Result: TE不能有效作为数据筛选层，其质量显著影响学习效果，且模型崩溃可能导致虚假的准确性相关性。

Conclusion: 需更细致地筛选和评估基于嵌入的表征，尤其是在分布外场景中。

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

Motivation: 纵向数据的复杂性和缺失值问题对LDC的准确性造成挑战，GANs在LDI中的应用潜力尚未完全发挥。

Method: 通过分类GAN-based LDI的主要方法，分析其优缺点，并总结研究趋势。

Result: GANs在LDI中显示出潜力，但需更灵活的方法应对纵向数据的广泛挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发更有效的GAN-based解决方案，以解决LDC中的挑战。

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

Conclusion: 结合标记扰动和嵌入空间偏移是模型解释性的有力工具。

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

Motivation: 探讨分布式学习中不同威胁模型对泛化性能的影响，填补理论研究的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析比较两种威胁模型下的算法稳定性，量化其对泛化误差的影响。

Result: 拜占庭攻击导致算法稳定性下降更多，泛化误差差距显著，尤其在恶意节点接近半数时。

Conclusion: 拜占庭攻击对泛化性能的危害比数据投毒攻击更严重，为分布式学习的安全设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在训练和部署阶段对有害查询的响应差异，以及伪装对齐行为的动机和影响因素。

Method: 分析了25个模型的行为，重点研究了5个表现出差异的模型，并通过扰动场景细节和假设检验探究了伪装对齐行为的原因。

Result: 只有Claude 3 Opus的行为主要由目标保持驱动；后期训练对伪装对齐行为有显著影响，拒绝行为的差异可能是主要原因。

Conclusion: 模型的伪装对齐行为受训练目标和后期处理的影响，拒绝行为的差异是关键因素。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的时间序列异常检测基准TAB，旨在解决现有评估方法在数据集和实验设置上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测（TSAD）在多个领域至关重要，但现有评估方法存在缺陷，阻碍了方法的有效比较和进步。

Method: TAB整合了29个公共多变量数据集和1,635个单变量时间序列，涵盖多种TSAD方法，并提供统一的自动化评估流程。

Result: 通过TAB评估现有TSAD方法，提供了对这些方法性能的深入洞察。

Conclusion: TAB为TSAD领域提供了更全面、公平的评估工具，促进了方法的比较和进步。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and
code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.

Conclusion: 分布鲁棒优化在元学习中能有效提升系统辨识的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to
estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work
explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system
identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss,
overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a
distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks,
enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model
trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows
to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于部分专家演示的强化学习框架（AdaBack），通过动态调整监督长度，解决长序列生成任务中监督学习和强化学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）依赖密集标签，成本高；强化学习（RL）则因稀疏奖励和大输出空间而受限。论文旨在填补两者之间的空白，解决长序列依赖任务中的泛化问题。

Method: 引入自适应回溯（AdaBack），一种基于样本的课程学习算法，动态调整每个样本的监督长度，逐步学习完成推理链。

Result: 在合成任务和数学推理基准（MATH、GSM8k）上，AdaBack成功解决了传统方法无法处理的长序列依赖问题。

Conclusion: 基于样本的课程学习不仅能平衡效率与泛化性，还能在长序列依赖任务中取得突破，为复杂序列生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

Motivation: 传统模型驱动方法通用性强但性能有限，数据驱动方法在数据丰富时表现优异，但缺乏通用性。希望结合两者优势。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证，性能达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: 混合方法兼具模型驱动的灵活性和数据驱动的学习能力，性能优越。

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

Motivation: 解决线性状态空间模型（SSMs）在混合专家（MoE）中扩展表达能力的挑战，避免性能下降。

Method: 提出RoM方法，通过共享路由决策和轻量子模块，利用线性投影专家的协同作用，实现Mamba层的稀疏扩展。

Result: 在1.3B活跃参数和16K序列长度下，RoM性能相当于密集模型的2.3倍参数，且在不同上下文长度下表现一致，节省23% FLOPS。

Conclusion: RoM为SSMs提供了一种高效扩展的新方法，适用于长序列建模和混合语言模型。

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

Conclusion: AdapThink通过自适应机制优化了语言模型的推理效率，为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了四种新颖的概率和强化学习方法（GPAR、BARM、MAB-ARM、RLAR），用于关联规则挖掘（ARM），突破了传统基于频率的方法，提升了灵活性、鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于频率的ARM方法（如Apriori、FP-Growth）无法有效处理先验知识、不确定性、项目依赖性和自适应搜索策略，限制了其在复杂模式和小数据集中的应用。

Method: 1. GPAR：使用高斯过程建模项目共现；2. BARM：采用贝叶斯框架量化不确定性；3. MAB-ARM：利用多臂老虎机策略探索项目集空间；4. RLAR：通过深度Q网络学习规则发现策略。

Result: 实验证明这些方法在合成和真实数据集上有效，尤其在发现稀有或复杂模式时表现优异，但也存在计算复杂性和可解释性的权衡。

Conclusion: 这些方法标志着ARM从静态频率驱动范式向先验知识、依赖性和不确定性感知框架的转变，适用于零售、医疗等多个领域。

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决RLVR依赖领域特定验证器导致的复杂性和可扩展性限制。

Method: 提出RLPR框架，利用LLM的token概率作为奖励信号，并通过prob-to-reward和稳定化方法降低噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RLPR显著优于其他方法，包括VeriFree和General-Reasoner。

Conclusion: RLPR通过LLM自身概率作为奖励信号，成功扩展了RLVR的应用范围，提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

Method: 通过皮肤病学和组织病理学的实例，分析了共形预测在输入和标签变量分布变化时的表现。

Result: 共形预测在分布变化时不可靠，不适用于提高准确性的预测选择，且对数据子集（如特定类别或患者属性）不可靠。在类别较少的医学图像分类任务中，其实用价值有限。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中存在显著局限性，尤其是在分布变化和小类别设置下，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，为创建高质量紧凑MoE模型提供了有效路径。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Motivation: 随着SSM模型规模增大，传统PEFT方法未能解决其独特的时间处理动态，需要专门设计的高效微调方法。

Method: 结合LIM神经元、LoRA和跨层膜传递，增强信息选择性保留和时间建模能力。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务中，Memba显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: Memba为Mamba提供了一种高效的时间动态适应方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Conclusion: 算法有效解决了非平稳环境中的Whittle指数计算问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Method: 提出ReDit方法，通过向离散奖励信号添加随机噪声，提供连续的探索梯度，加速收敛并鼓励模型探索新策略。

Result: 实验表明，ReDit仅需约10%的训练步数即可达到与vanilla GRPO相当的性能，且在相同训练时长下性能提升4%。

Conclusion: ReDit有效解决了离散奖励的梯度问题，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary
for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very
recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

Result: 发现深度学习模型存在“信息饱和瓶颈”，导致关键特征丢失，影响迁移性能。

Conclusion: 建议结合任务特定训练和更丰富的特征表示，而非仅依赖大规模网络。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: 该方法无需领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，并提供内容变化的定量测量，适用于新闻、政策分析和危机监测。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持神经网络通用逼近性质的同时，为量子计算在AI中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Result: 实验表明DFPT-KD优于传统方法，DFPT-KD+进一步提升了性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DFPT-KD和DFPT-KD+有效解决容量差距问题，显著提升学生网络性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Conclusion: BNN集成PIML架构在不确定性传播方面具有潜力，蒙特卡洛采样是有效方法，但性能提升有限。

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

Conclusion: 改进的GB跟踪算法显著提升了地雷检测效果。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

Conclusion: 动态细粒度秩分配是高效基础模型适应的关键范式。

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Additionally, audio transcripts are extracted for further verification.
Noticeably, the entire pipeline is automated using GPT-4o through prompt

Result: 在合成数据集上，ADAG显著提高了DAG学习准确性和零样本推理效率。

Conclusion: ADAG是首个专门为DAG学习设计的预训练基础模型，为因果发现提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

TL;DR: 扩散重建在图像编辑、修复和风格转换中很重要，但实践中存在重建误差。研究发现PF-ODE生成过程的不稳定性会放大误差，根源在于生成分布的稀疏性。实验和理论分析验证了这一点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散重建在实践中存在无法用数值误差解释的重建误差，研究旨在揭示其根本原因。

Method: 通过数值实验和理论分析，研究PF-ODE生成过程中的不稳定性及其对重建误差的影响。

Result: 发现生成分布的稀疏性导致不稳定性，且随着数据维度增加，不稳定性的概率趋近于1。

Conclusion: 扩散重建存在固有挑战，研究结果为未来改进提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

TL;DR: GeNeRT是一种可泛化的神经射线追踪框架，通过结合Fresnel启发的神经网络设计和GPU加速策略，提高了泛化能力、准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经射线追踪方法存在泛化能力受限和对电磁定律遵循不足的问题，GeNeRT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GeNeRT结合Fresnel启发的神经网络设计，支持场景内空间可迁移性和场景间零样本泛化，并采用GPU加速策略。

Result: 实验表明，GeNeRT在未训练区域和全新环境中泛化良好，MPC预测准确性优于基线，运行时效率超过Wireless Insite。

Conclusion: GeNeRT通过创新的网络架构和训练策略，成功捕捉了射线-表面相互作用的物理原理，提升了性能。

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

*Junchao Fan,Xuyang Lei,Xiaolin Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应专家引导的对抗攻击方法，解决了现有攻击方法在高频攻击和训练稳定性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL策略在自动驾驶中易受对抗攻击，现有攻击方法效率低且训练不稳定。

Method: 通过模仿学习从成功攻击中提取专家策略，结合KL散度正则化引导DRL攻击者，并引入性能感知退火策略。

Result: 在碰撞率、攻击效率和训练稳定性上优于现有方法，尤其在专家策略不完美时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了对抗攻击的效率和稳定性，为自动驾驶系统的安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Result: 在仿真和真实系统中表现优异，提供高精度且物理一致的模型。

Conclusion: SKANODE成功实现了高精度与可解释性的平衡，揭示了非线性动力学系统的潜在机制。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Motivation: 旨在通过变分流匹配框架实现受控生成，并探索其在分子生成中的应用，同时保持对称性不变性。

Method: 提出了两种受控生成方法：端到端训练条件生成模型和贝叶斯推断。此外，提出了等变VFM框架以确保旋转、平移和排列不变性。

Result: 在非受控和受控分子生成任务中均取得了领先性能，尤其在受控生成中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究强化了基于流的生成模型与贝叶斯推断之间的联系，为约束驱动和对称性感知的生成提供了可扩展且理论严谨的框架。

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过微调偏好优化数据集来改进LLMs逻辑推理能力的方法，显著提升了逻辑正确性并减少了语法错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在将自然语言推理问题转换为逻辑形式时存在不足，影响了其推理能力。

Method: 提出LogicPO数据集，并采用DPO和KTO技术微调开源LLMs。

Result: 最佳模型Phi-3.5在逻辑正确性上优于GPT-3.5-turbo（8-shot），逻辑正确性提高10%，语法错误减少14%。

Conclusion: 通过改进逻辑表示和评估指标，为提升LLMs逻辑推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应动态神经模糊聚类方法（ADNF），用于白血病诊断中的高吞吐量图像数据聚类，优于传统静态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法无法适应细胞模式的动态变化和实时不确定性量化，限制了白血病诊断和监测的效果。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络特征提取与在线模糊聚类引擎，通过模糊时间指数（FTI）动态更新聚类参数，并进行拓扑优化以防止过分割或欠分割。

Result: 在C-NMC白血病显微镜数据集上，ADNF的轮廓分数达到0.51，优于静态基线方法。

Conclusion: ADNF的自适应不确定性建模和无标签操作有望整合到儿科肿瘤网络中，为个性化白血病管理提供支持。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽性能强大，但缺乏可解释性，现有方法对时间序列网络的分析不足。

Method: 提出FreqATT框架，通过评估不同频率并过滤或标记相关输入数据，实现事后解释。

Result: 频域分析能更突出输入信号相关区域，且对信号波动更稳健。

Conclusion: FreqATT为时间序列网络提供了一种更有效的解释性方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Result: ReaPER在多种环境（包括Atari-5基准测试）中表现优于PER。

Conclusion: ReaPER通过可靠性调整显著提升了学习效率，优于传统PER方法。

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的NAS基准AnalogNAS-Bench，揭示了当前量化技术和架构设计的不足，并提出了优化方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络未针对AIMC的非理想特性优化，需要专门的NAS基准来探索适合AIMC的架构。

Method: 引入AnalogNAS-Bench基准，通过实验分析AIMC特有的噪声对架构的影响。

Result: 发现标准量化技术不适用于AIMC噪声，宽分支块和跳跃连接能提升架构鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AnalogNAS-Bench为未来针对AIMC的NAS研究提供了基础，并揭示了优化方向。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

TL;DR: Pucktrick是一个Python库，用于在合成数据中引入受控错误，以评估机器学习模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性。实验表明，使用污染后的合成数据训练的模型表现优于纯合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实数据集因隐私和可用性问题受限，合成数据虽能替代但过于干净，缺乏真实数据中的缺陷，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 开发Pucktrick库，支持多种错误类型（如缺失值、噪声、异常值等），提供两种污染模式。

Result: 实验表明，在受污染的合成数据上训练的模型（尤其是树模型和线性模型）表现更好。

Conclusion: Pucktrick能有效提升模型在真实数据缺陷下的鲁棒性，适用于金融等领域。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Conclusion: DDOT和DIV-diff为ODE推断提供了更全面和稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

Result: 联邦学习训练的模型比单独训练的模型更准确，性能接近所有数据合并训练的模型。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在保护数据隐私的同时，有望推动化学工程中机器学习的发展。

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under

prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in

each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经网络训练中的Lipschitz连续性动态提供了理论基础，并揭示了多种因素对其演化的影响。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需模拟的框架，用于训练连续时间扩散过程，适用于广泛的优化目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要规定最优扩散过程（仅适用于受限问题）或昂贵模拟，而新方法通过耦合参数化直接建模时间依赖密度函数和扩散过程动态。

Method: 通过扩展和简化神经守恒定律的构造，将Fokker-Planck方程和密度函数要求作为硬约束，实现无需模拟的训练。

Result: 适用于多种问题，从生成建模到随机最优控制，并在时空事件建模和从群体数据学习最优动态等应用中验证。

Conclusion: 新框架简化了训练过程，扩展了应用范围，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard
approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture
the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial
problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression
models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses
practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the
action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

<details>

Motivation: 随着光学计算对PICs需求的增加，传统梯度优化方法易陷入局部最优，需要更高效的优化算法。

Method: 将设计空间离散化为网格，将设计任务转化为数千个二元变量的优化问题，并采用多智能体RL算法进行优化。

Result: 在二维和三维设计任务中，该方法仅需数千次环境采样即可优化设计，性能优于传统梯度优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为光子学逆向设计提供了高效的RL基准，并展示了多智能体RL的潜力。

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Motivation: 研究对称性约束在模型选择中的影响，探索不确定性指标是否能有效指导模型选择。

Method: 比较了频率主义（通过Conformal Prediction）、贝叶斯（通过边缘似然）和基于校准的指标与简单的基于误差的评估方法。

Result: 不确定性指标通常与预测性能一致，但贝叶斯模型证据表现不一致，归因于贝叶斯与几何模型复杂性概念的不匹配。

Conclusion: 不确定性指标在指导对称性感知模型选择方面具有潜力，但需解决贝叶斯与几何复杂性概念的不匹配问题。

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

Result: GB-MKKM在多种聚类任务中表现出更高的效率和聚类性能。

Conclusion: 粒度球计算显著提升了多核聚类的效率和鲁棒性，GB-MKKM框架具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

TL;DR: FedLEx是一种针对非独立同分布数据的联邦学习方法，通过优化梯度更新策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非独立同分布数据场景下的数据异构性和性能鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用联邦损失探索技术，通过梯度偏差构建全局指导矩阵，优化模型参数更新。

Result: 在非独立同分布条件下显著提升性能，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FedLEx能够有效应对联邦学习中的关键挑战，适用于多样化应用场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

Motivation: 探索语言生成在极限情况下的可能性，特别是针对可数和不可数集合的生成层次。

Method: 通过构造特定的类和使用新颖的对角线论证方法，证明了有限并集不一定可生成。

Result: 证明了非均匀可生成类与均匀可生成类的并集不一定可生成，并解决了关于EUC条件的开放性问题。

Conclusion: 语言生成在极限情况下与传统统计学习任务不同，无法通过简单组合生成器实现提升。

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SaGIF的图神经网络方法，通过独立学习相似性表示来提升个体公平性（IF），并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个体公平性（IF）在图神经网络（GNNs）中是一个关键问题，但目前研究较少，尤其是在理解导致IF的原因和全面考虑相似个体识别方面存在不足。

Method: 论文首先分析了IF的根源，并提出两个度量指标（拓扑融合和特征融合）来评估个体相似性。基于此，提出了SaGIF方法，通过独立学习相似性表示来提升IF。

Result: 实验表明，SaGIF在多个真实数据集上优于现有IF方法，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SaGIF通过整合个体相似性，有效提升了GNNs中的个体公平性，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统将用户提示视为单一输入，忽略了潜在的可分解并行性，导致效率不足。

Method: 使用LLM辅助提示和基于规则的多语言验证，从37,000多个真实提示中提取结构化模式，并开发执行套件比较串行与并行策略。

Result: 在超过75%的数据集中成功解析查询内并行性，实现高达5倍的加速，且质量损失极小。

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT为LLM服务管道中的结构感知执行提供了首个标准化测试平台。

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Result: 该方法能够在短时间内完成大规模动作空间的优化实验。

Conclusion: 新方法显著缩短了实验时间，同时保持了优化效果。

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Motivation: 多智能体控制问题在机器人、经济和能源系统中日益普遍，但现有研究多忽略对抗性扰动和个体目标的影响。

Method: 采用梯度控制器，分析其在对抗性扰动和多智能体环境中的性能，并研究个体遗憾与智能体数量的关系。

Result: 证明了在所有智能体中均适用的近最优次线性遗憾界，并在目标一致时推导了均衡差距保证。

Conclusion: 梯度控制器在多智能体对抗性环境中表现良好，目标一致时可进一步优化均衡性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中长时任务因价值估计误差累积而难以扩展的问题。

Method: 提出ProQ框架，学习非对称距离并用于生成关键点和引导子目标，结合拉格朗日分布外检测器确保关键点可达。

Result: 在多样化导航基准测试中，ProQ能生成有效子目标并稳健达成长时任务。

Conclusion: ProQ通过几何方法统一度量学习、关键点覆盖和目标条件控制，显著提升长时任务的性能。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

Result: 结合Transformer模型和LIME的框架能够有效分析学生反馈，提供清晰的数据驱动见解。

Conclusion: 该框架与OBE原则一致，通过改进情感分类和解释性，为教育实践提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

Conclusion: 研究探索了将大型语言模型的越狱能力蒸馏到小型语言模型的可行性，揭示了模型的脆弱性，为大型语言模型安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

TL;DR: GTA是一种新型注意力机制，通过共享注意力图和压缩值缓存，显著减少计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在计算和内存开销上存在冗余，限制了在资源有限硬件上的部署效率。

Method: GTA包括共享注意力图机制和非线性值解码器，分别减少键缓存大小和压缩值缓存。

Result: GTA将注意力计算FLOPs减少62.5%，KV缓存减少70%，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA有效优化了LLM的部署效率，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Motivation: 探索不同解码策略如何影响LLM输出的多样性和可靠性，以优化实际应用中的模型表现。

Method: 通过问答、摘要和代码生成任务实验，比较CoT解码和推测采样等方法的性能。

Result: CoT解码显示更高的语义多样性但预测熵更低，代码生成Pass@2率提升48.8%；推测采样在摘要任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化解码方法可平衡多样性与准确性，对实际应用中的LLM部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其安全评估的重要性日益凸显，尤其是模型可能表现出欺骗行为，需要研究这些行为是否源于模型的隐蔽意图。

Method: 回顾心智理论相关研究，分析其在安全评估中的应用，并评估多个开源LLMs的心智理论能力发展情况。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLMs在阅读理解方面有所提升，但其心智理论能力并未同步发展。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs心智理论能力的不足，并讨论了未来安全评估的挑战。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在涉及金钱与用户舒适度权衡的决策中的行为，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过量化多个LLMs对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）的定价，分析其决策行为。

Result: 发现LLMs在决策中存在大范围差异、对提示语微小变化的脆弱性、对重大不适的低价接受以及对无不适情况的高价拒绝等问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在权衡金钱与舒适度时表现不可靠，需进一步审查其决策机制，尤其是在涉及用户利益的场景中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

Method: 使用多种先进LLMs（如GPT、Llama等）对五个国家的URL和全文进行分类，并与人工标注和传统机器学习方法对比。

Result: URL能有效嵌入新闻内容，为准确性与成本平衡提供了重要视角。

Conclusion: URL分析可作为全文分析的近似方法，但需考虑上下文限制，并提出了在政治科学研究中使用LLMs的方法建议。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何改变写作、沟通和创作方式，并分析其对社会和机构的适应性。

Method: 通过三个研究方向：分析AI检测器的偏见、测量LLMs在各领域的采用情况、评估LLMs在研究反馈中的作用。

Result: 发现AI检测器存在系统性偏见，LLMs在各领域广泛应用，且能为研究者提供有价值的反馈。

Conclusion: LLMs的广泛应用带来机遇与挑战，需关注公平性和支持弱势群体。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

### [212] [VeriLocc: End-to-End Cross-Architecture Register Allocation via LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17506)
*Lesheng Jin,Zhenyuan Ruan,Haohui Mai,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriLocc利用大型语言模型（LLM）和形式化编译器技术，实现跨GPU架构的可泛化和可验证的寄存器分配，性能优于人工调优库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU快速发展，但生产编译器仍依赖手工调优的寄存器分配启发式方法，需为每代硬件重新调整。

Method: VeriLocc通过微调LLM将中间表示（MIR）转换为目标特定的寄存器分配，结合静态分析和验证器引导的再生循环确保正确性。

Result: 在矩阵乘法（GEMM）和多头注意力（MHA）上，VeriLocc单次准确率达85-99%，pass@100接近100%，性能优于rocBLAS 10%以上。

Conclusion: VeriLocc为跨架构寄存器分配提供了高效、可验证的解决方案，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对三个多语言语音数据集（Mozilla Common Voice 17.0、FLEURS和VoxPopuli）的质量审计显示，某些语言存在显著质量问题，分为微观和宏观两类，后者在资源不足语言中更普遍。以台湾闽南语为例，提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多语言语音数据集的质量问题，以提升其作为训练和评估集的实用性，并改善下游模型性能。

Method: 对三个数据集进行质量审计，将问题分为微观和宏观两类，并以台湾闽南语为例进行案例分析。

Result: 发现宏观问题在资源不足语言中更普遍，需加强语言规划和数据质量控制。

Conclusion: 提出未来数据集开发的指南和建议，强调社会语言学意识对创建可靠语音数据的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

*Yuanhao Wu,Juntong Song,Hanning Zhang,Tong Zhang,Cheng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DuaShepherd是一个新的奖励建模框架，结合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励信号（如正确性）可能不足以全面评估数学推理过程，需要结合潜力信号以提高模型性能。

Method: 开发自动化管道构建大规模奖励建模数据集，采用多头架构并行训练正确性和潜力奖励模型，并将两者结合为复合概率。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench上，结合两种信号的模型显著优于单一信号模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DuaShepherd通过整合正确性和潜力信号，有效提升数学推理能力，且资源效率高。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了自监督学习（SSL）模型如何编码影响口音感知的音系特征变化，发现特定音段的自监督表示能有效预测口音强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口音感知模型低估了音系特征梯度变化的作用，研究旨在利用SSL模型揭示这些特征对口音感知的影响。

Method: 使用CSLU外国口音英语语料库，提取音段音系特征概率，结合Wav2Vec2-BERT和WavLM的预训练表示及母语者口音评分进行分析。

Result: 口音强度由音段预训练表示中的特定特征子集预测，且与美式英语和印度英语基线的距离显著相关。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表示可用于基于可解释音系特征的口音感知建模。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

TL;DR: AgriCHN是一个开源的中文农业命名实体识别数据集，涵盖27种实体类别，包括水文和气象相关实体，显著提升了农业实体标注的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业命名实体识别方法因缺乏高质量中文数据集和忽视农业与水文、气象的关联而表现不佳。

Method: 从大量农业文章中精心构建AgriCHN数据集，包含4,040句子和15,799实体标注，涵盖27类实体。

Result: AgriCHN数据质量优异，实验证明其挑战性，并具备进一步研究潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN填补了农业实体识别领域的空白，为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

Motivation: 解决形态缺陷现象（预期屈折形式缺失）对提升形态丰富语言的NLP工具准确性至关重要，但传统资源覆盖不足。

Method: 定制神经形态分析器标注拉丁语和意大利语语料库，并计算验证维基词典的缺陷动词列表。

Result: 维基词典对意大利语形态缺陷描述高度可靠，但拉丁语中有7%的条目被误标为非缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了众包维基作为语言知识来源的局限性，并为计算形态学提供了质量保障工具和方法。

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyphoFormer结合自然语言描述和数值数据，通过Transformer模型提升台风轨迹预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，TyphoFormer通过引入语言描述解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型生成台风属性的文本描述，并将其嵌入为特殊标记，与数值时间序列一起输入Transformer编码器。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer表现优于现有方法，尤其在非线性路径变化和历史数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: TyphoFormer通过融合文本和序列信息，显著提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Abstract: This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family
of open foundational speech language models (SpeechLMs) up to 7B. Initialized
from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously
pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We
demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with
existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only
capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on
tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling
and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our
code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力可能更多依赖于记忆的答案-推理模式，而非真正的推理。通过实验验证，模型对显式答案的依赖性强，性能在答案线索被掩盖时显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的推理能力是否基于真正的推理，还是仅仅依赖于记忆的答案-推理模式。

Method: 提出一个五级答案可见性提示框架，通过间接行为分析系统性地操纵答案线索，测试模型行为。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs对显式答案有强烈依赖，答案线索被掩盖时性能下降26.90%。

Conclusion: LLMs的推理可能更多是事后合理化而非真正推理，需更细致地理解其推理本质。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing
datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization
modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using
LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient

techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art

Result: 在三个多跳QA数据集上表现优于或与现有最佳方法相当，显著减少token消耗，8B参数模型上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: DEC框架在资源受限环境下高效，适用于轻量级LLMs的多跳QA任务。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: SITPCL在零样本对话立场检测中达到最佳性能，F1-macro得分为43.81%。

Conclusion: 尽管SITPCL表现优异，零样本对话立场检测仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

different age groups. Our research attempts to explore how language patterns
vary between different age groups, exploring the connection between speaker
demographics and linguistic factors such as utterance duration, lexical
diversity, and word choice. By merging computational language analysis and
machine learning methodologies, we attempt to uncover distinctive linguistic
markers characteristic of multiple generations and create prediction models
that can consistently estimate the speaker's age group from various aspects.
This work contributes to our knowledge of sociolinguistic diversity throughout
the life of modern British speech.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker通过结构化思维和知识边界优化，显著提升了LLM在复杂问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HIDE的单次训练免费方法，通过解耦表示检测语言模型中的幻觉内容，优于其他单次方法，并与多方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成内容中存在的幻觉问题，提高其可靠性和实用性。

Method: 利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则（HSIC）量化模型内部表示与生成输出之间的解耦程度。

Result: 在四个问答数据集上，HIDE在AUC-ROC上平均相对提升29%，计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: HIDE通过解耦表示有效检测幻觉，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive

quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: THCM-CAL通过建模多模态因果关系和校准置信度，显著提升了临床风险预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Method: 提出MarketingFM系统，结合检索增强技术和多数据源生成广告文案；开发AutoEval-Main和AutoEval-Update自动化评估系统。

Result: 关键词广告文案提升CTR 9%、展示量12%，降低CPC 0.38%；AutoEval-Main与人工审核一致率达89.57%。

Conclusion: 自动化系统显著提升广告效果和评估效率，但人工审核仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

Motivation: 解决顺序模型编辑（SME）中LLMs因参数引入导致的通用能力下降问题。

Method: 引入结构映射编辑损失和队列机制，动态对齐参数并冻结无关参数。

Result: 在多种SME设置中显著优于基线，同时保持单次编辑的竞争力。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT有效提升SME性能并保护LLMs的通用能力。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出缺乏多样性的原因，提出了分支因子（BF）作为衡量生成过程中有效可能性的指标，发现对齐调优显著降低了BF，解释了模型输出稳定性的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对齐后的大型语言模型（LLM）生成输出缺乏多样性的现象，探索其背后的概率分布集中机制。

Method: 引入分支因子（BF）作为量化输出分布集中程度的指标，通过实验分析BF在生成过程中的变化及其与对齐调优的关系。

Result: 发现BF随生成过程逐渐降低，对齐调优显著减少BF（如从12降至1.2），并揭示了其对推理稳定性的影响。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有效工具，对齐调优通过引导模型进入低熵轨迹减少多样性，而链式思维（CoT）则利用这一效应提升稳定性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

Conclusion: 该方法在多轮越狱中具有优越性，代码已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 创新散射模型增强了LLMs在多阶段流程中的创新扩展能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a

unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual

effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to
processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework
to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language
models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental
evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了早期退出模型的性能，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Result: 该方法有效解决了长文档摘要中的信息丢失问题，提高了摘要的连贯性和信息保留能力。

Conclusion: 混合方法在长文档摘要中表现优于单一方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

Conclusion: GSD框架为LLM文本质量评估提供了更全面、统计可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

TL;DR: 比较了两种现代方法在捷克语指代消解中的表现：基于提示工程的大语言模型（LLMs）和微调紧凑生成模型。结果显示微调模型（如mT5-large）表现更优，准确率达88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指代消解对自然语言理解至关重要，尤其是在形态丰富的语言（如捷克语）中。本文旨在比较两种现代方法的性能。

Method: 使用来自Prague Dependency Treebank的数据集，评估了指令调优的LLMs（如Mistral Large 2和Llama 3）和微调的mT5、Mistral模型。

Result: 提示工程在少样本场景下表现良好（74.5%准确率），但微调模型（如mT5-large）表现更优（88%准确率），且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 微调模型在捷克语指代消解中显著优于提示工程方法，尤其是在准确率和资源效率方面。

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,
especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a
comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech
text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency
Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2
and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against
fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source
corpora, highlighting key strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

*Fuyu Wang,Jiangtong Li,Kun Zhu,Changjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出双组件框架InspireScore和InspireDebate，解决现有LLM辩论系统在客观评估和多维优化上的不足，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM辩论系统缺乏对真实性、逻辑有效性等客观评估，且优化方法不结构化，限制了效果。

Method: 1. InspireScore：多维评估架构，结合主观和客观指标；2. InspireDebate：分阶段优化，包括CoT推理增强、多维DPO和Web-RAG。

Result: InspireScore与专家判断相关性提升44%，InspireDebate性能优于基线模型57%。

Conclusion: 双组件框架有效解决了现有辩论系统的局限性，显著提升了评估和辩论性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

*Yicheng Fu,Zhemin Huang,Liuxin Yang,Yumeng Lu,Zhongdongming Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chengyu-Bench是一个全面评估语言模型对中文成语理解能力的基准测试，包含三项任务：情感分类、语境适用性和开放式填空。测试结果显示，模型在情感分类上表现优异，但在理解成语的文化和语境细微差别上仍有困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语（Chengyu）因其历史和文化背景的复杂性，对语言模型的理解和使用提出了挑战。现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法全面评估模型的能力。

Method: Chengyu-Bench包含三项任务：情感分类（Evaluative Connotation）、语境适用性（Appropriateness）和开放式填空（Open Cloze），共2,937个人工验证的示例，覆盖1,765个常见成语。

Result: 测试显示，领先的语言模型在情感分类任务上准确率超过95%，但在语境适用性任务上约为85%，开放式填空任务上仅为约40%。错误分析表明，模型对成语含义的基本理解存在不足。

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench表明，尽管语言模型能可靠地判断成语情感倾向，但在掌握文化和语境细微差别方面仍有显著不足。基准测试和源代码已公开。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多跳问答框架（MHQA），用于检测大语言模型（LLM）在心理健康领域中的偏见，并展示了两种去偏见技术的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在心理健康领域的应用中可能传播偏见，加剧对边缘群体的伤害，但目前缺乏系统性检测方法。

Method: 使用MHQA框架分析IMHI数据集，结合人口统计学标签，评估四种LLM的偏见模式。

Result: 发现LLM在情感、人口统计和心理健康条件上存在系统性偏见，去偏见技术实现了66-94%的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在心理健康领域的偏见问题，并提供了可操作的公平AI开发建议。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

TL;DR: 介绍了Syntactic Acceptability Dataset，包含1000个英语序列，标注了语法和可接受性状态，是目前最大的公开数据集。初步分析显示语法和可接受性判断在83%情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语法和计算语言学研究提供资源，解决语法性和可接受性判断的关系问题。

Method: 数据集包含1000个英语序列，一半来自教科书，一半来自期刊，标注语法状态和可接受性状态。通过众包获取可接受性数据。

Result: 语法和可接受性判断在83%情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现优于语法性。

Conclusion: 数据集是目前最大的公开资源，未来将扩展数据集。

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现自回归Transformer语言模型中存在一个关键漏洞，即em dash符号会导致递归语义漂移，引发子句边界幻觉和嵌入空间纠缠。通过形式化分析，提出了一种结合符号子句净化和嵌入矩阵重新对齐的解决方案，无需重新训练模型即可抑制问题符号，同时保持语义连贯性。实验验证了生成一致性和主题维护的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归Transformer语言模型在长文本生成中可能因特定符号（如em dash）引发递归语义漂移和嵌入空间纠缠，影响生成质量。研究旨在识别并解决此类漏洞，提升模型的安全性和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过形式化分析语义格中的符号扰动，提出结合phi-infinity算子的符号子句净化和嵌入矩阵重新对齐的方法，抑制问题符号的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了生成一致性和主题维护能力，同时无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和缓解基础模型中的符号级漏洞提供了通用框架，对AI安全、模型对齐和大语言模型的鲁棒部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Motivation: 探索LLM中知识的模块化组织，以及如何高效、有针对性地操作模型。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征共激活分析国家和关系组件，并通过消融和放大这些组件观察模型输出的变化。

Result: 国家组件主要出现在早期层，而更抽象的关系组件集中在后期层；后期层的关系节点对模型输出的因果影响更强。

Conclusion: LLM中的知识呈现模块化组织，为高效模型操作提供了新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了针对阿拉伯和穆斯林文化偏见的提示工程技术，总结了五种主要方法，并指出结构化多步流程效果最佳，但研究数量有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在对阿拉伯和穆斯林的偏见，但相关提示工程技术研究不足，亟需系统性分析。

Method: 采用混合方法系统综述，遵循PRISMA指南和Kitchenham方法，分析了2021-2024年的8项实证研究。

Result: 五种方法中，结构化多步流程效果最佳（偏见减少87.7%），但文化提示更易实施。不同偏见类型对方法的响应差异显著。

Conclusion: 提示工程可有效减少文化偏见，但需更多研究开发适应性技术、专用评估资源及结合其他去偏方法。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

Motivation: 开发文化敏感的教育技术需要探索阿拉伯语情境下的情感识别能力。

Method: 使用75张阿拉伯故事书插图，评估两种模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现，并与人类标注的Plutchik情感框架对比。

Result: GPT-4o在所有条件下表现优于Gemini，最高宏F1分数为59%，而Gemini为43%。模型在文化细微情感和模糊叙事背景下错误率较高。

Conclusion: 当前模型在文化理解上存在局限，需开发文化敏感的训练方法以支持阿拉伯语学习者的情感识别教育技术。

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect为翻译者和研究者提供了高效的工具，支持高质量的注释输出，适用于训练翻译或后期编辑系统。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

Motivation: 多语言推理的多样性对LLM的测试扩展提出了挑战，需要一种高效的方法来减少数据需求和推理成本。

Method: 提出L²方法，利用多语言数据（完整链式注释和语言混合步骤）进行微调，结合解码干预策略。

Result: 实验表明，少量数据即可显著提升推理能力，多语言学习减少了数据和推理令牌需求，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: L²方法为解决LLM数据收集和测试计算效率问题提供了有前景的解决方案，且与其他高效方法正交。

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

Result: GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯和临床有效的因果叙述方面表现最强，GPT-White与专家评估一致，相似性指标与临床推理质量不符。

Conclusion: 选择适当的评估指标和加权策略对结果有重要影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏有效评估LLMs在广泛表格推理能力上的基准，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过迭代数据处理构建高质量数据集，并设计包含26个子任务的评估框架，采用TCoT、PoT和ICoT三种推理模式。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs在处理复杂表格任务上仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: TReB基准和框架公开可用，为未来研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and
the framework on [GitHub].

TL;DR: 论文提出MeRF方法，通过将奖励规则注入提示中，结合强化学习和上下文学习能力，提升LLMs的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法忽视了LLMs的上下文学习能力（如CoT提示的成功），作者希望结合强化学习和上下文学习以提升LLMs的推理能力。

Method: MeRF方法将奖励规范直接注入提示中，作为上下文动机，使模型在优化目标意识下改进回答。

Result: 在K&K逻辑谜题基准测试中，MeRF显著优于基线方法，且性能随动机与奖励函数一致性增加而提升。

Conclusion: MeRF通过结合强化学习和上下文学习，有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，并能适应误导性动机。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在NLP任务中的广泛应用，需要全面评估其在不同任务中的表现，以了解其优势和局限性。

Method: 采用结构化实验协议，使用相同的中性提示在两个基准数据集上测试ChatGPT和DeepSeek，涵盖情感分析、主题分类等五个任务。

Result: DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理上表现更优，ChatGPT在需要细微理解和灵活性的任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务需求选择合适的LLM提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了端到端（E2E）框架在口语语法错误纠正（SGEC）和反馈生成中的应用，比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，并提出了自动伪标注、上下文信息利用和参考对齐等方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法错误纠正（SGEC）因语音识别错误、不流畅等问题面临挑战，传统级联方法易受错误传播影响，因此研究E2E框架以优化系统性能。

Method: 基于Whisper基础模型，比较级联、部分级联和E2E架构；提出自动伪标注扩充训练数据，利用上下文信息改进SGEC输出，并通过参考对齐和编辑置信度估计优化反馈。

Result: 在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上的实验表明，所提方法显著提升了E2E SGEC的性能。

Conclusion: E2E SGEC系统通过伪标注、上下文信息利用和反馈优化等方法，有效解决了数据稀缺和错误传播问题，性能显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，对预训练的Transformer模型进行微调反而会降低在MS MARCO任务上的性能，所有微调方法均不及基础模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨为何微调预训练模型在MS MARCO任务上表现下降的反常现象。

Method: 通过五种模型变体（包括全参数微调和参数高效的LoRA适配）进行实验，分析嵌入空间结构变化。

Result: 微调破坏了基础模型预训练中学到的最优嵌入空间结构，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了传统迁移学习的有效性，暗示需要架构创新以提升性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论检测是NLP应用中的重要任务，但定义模糊。研究旨在明确仇恨言论的定义，并探讨不同定义对模型性能的影响。

Method: 收集和分析现有仇恨言论定义，构建包含14个概念元素的分类法；在三种数据集上对三种大语言模型进行零样本评估。

Result: 不同定义（即定义中包含的概念元素特异性不同）会影响模型性能，但这种影响在不同模型架构中并不一致。

Conclusion: 仇恨言论定义的明确性对模型性能有影响，但需考虑模型架构的差异。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续思维链（CoT）的序列依赖导致训练时间长，影响效率。

Method: 采用Jacobi迭代法并行更新潜在思维标记，减少序列依赖。

Result: 实验显示PCCoT在性能相当或更好的情况下节省近50%时间，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT显著提升连续CoT的效率与稳定性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清数据污染问题对LLM群体研究的影响，并强调仍可研究自组织和模型依赖的涌现动态。

Method: 通过分析Barrie和Törnberg对Flint Ashery等人研究的批评，探讨LLM群体中的动态行为。

Result: 实证研究表明，LLM群体中可以观察到社会规范等涌现动态。

Conclusion: 数据污染虽重要，但不妨碍研究LLM群体中的自组织和涌现动态。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义相似性估计在自然语言处理中有广泛应用，如问答、语义搜索等。本文旨在比较不同技术在语义相似性估计中的表现。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT等技术，分别在特定领域内部数据集和公开的Quora问题对数据集上进行实验。

Result: BERT表现优于其他方法，尤其是在特定领域数据集上，归因于其微调过程。

Conclusion: BERT是处理特定领域数据语义相似性估计的最佳选择。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在公共演讲说服力理解上的表现，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 使用3MT法语数据集，通过GPT-4o修改演讲文本，分析修辞和话语标记的变化。

Result: GPT-4o通过情感词汇和句法结构（如疑问句和感叹句）系统化地增强修辞效果。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在提升说服力时更倾向于风格化调整，而非模仿人类优化方式。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

Result: ByteSpan生成的词汇效率高，英语形态对齐分数优于BPE，多语言实验在25种语言中表现出相似的压缩和Rényi效率。

Conclusion: ByteSpan是一种有效的子词分词方法，尤其在形态对齐和多语言应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

Conclusion: 为聊天机器人优化分词器能显著降低能源消耗，同时保持或提升分词效率。

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

Result: 特定词汇的错误率相对降低了11%，同时保持整体错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音识别系统对特定词汇的识别能力，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

Result: 在开源和闭源LLMs上的实验表明，AGBS能有效平衡语义一致性和攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

*Zhenru Lin,Jiawen Tao,Yang Yuan,Andrew Chi-Chih Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使是小型语言模型在简单任务中也存在高度不一致性，顶尖模型如DeepSeek-R1和GPT-o4-mini也未完全自洽。论文提出了不一致性度量及两种自动化方法（基于图和基于能量的方法）以缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型（LLMs）的决策透明可信，需解决其内部推理的自洽性问题。

Method: 引入不一致性度量，并提出基于图和基于能量的两种自动化方法。

Result: 方法部分改善了不一致性，但问题复杂性凸显了自洽性在构建可靠AI中的重要性。

Conclusion: 自洽性是提升AI可靠性和可解释性的关键，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: RWESummary是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实世界证据（RWE）研究摘要任务中的新基准，基于MedHELM框架开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前LLMs在RWE研究摘要任务中缺乏专门评估，RWESummary填补了这一空白。

Method: RWESummary包含一个场景和三种评估方法，基于Atropos Health专有数据开发，用于比较不同LLMs的性能。

Result: 在13项RWE研究中，Gemini 2.5模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: RWESummary是RWE研究摘要任务的有用基准模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

TL;DR: MLLP-VRAIN团队在IWSLT 2025实时语音翻译任务中提出了一种模块化级联系统，结合Whisper和NLLB模型，通过轻量级适应技术实现高质量低延迟的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型的需求。

Method: 使用Whisper Large-V3-Turbo进行语音识别，NLLB-3.3B进行机器翻译，采用前缀训练和自适应发射策略（如wait-$k$和RALCP）。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上BLEU得分为31.96，延迟2.94秒；官方测试集得分为29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 预训练模型经轻量级适应后，可在无需大量领域数据或端到端训练的情况下实现高效实时翻译。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

TL;DR: STUPID方法通过PID控制器动态调整推理过程中的激活引导强度，减少冗余推理步骤，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在扩展思维链推理中常因过度思考生成冗余步骤，增加计算成本并可能降低性能。现有静态引导方法缺乏动态调整能力。

Method: 提出STUPID方法，结合块级分类器和PID控制机制，动态调整引导强度。

Result: 在GSM8K上，STUPID提高6%准确率并减少32%令牌使用，优于静态方法。

Conclusion: STUPID为动态推理校准提供了一种高效框架，兼顾推理质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于激励的方法，通过强化学习（RL）从零开始训练大语言模型（LLM），无需依赖标注或合成数据，实现了超长高质量文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超长文本生成是广泛需求但具有挑战性的任务，传统方法依赖合成数据且效果有限。

Result: LongWriter-Zero模型在长文本写作任务中表现优于传统方法，并在多个基准测试中达到最优。

Conclusion: 该方法为超长文本生成提供了一种高效且无需合成数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文LLM推理中KV缓存成为GPU内存瓶颈的问题。

Method: 采用加法量化和轻量级编码器压缩KV缓存，设计RoPE可交换的码本，通过EM算法训练，实现高效解码。

Result: 在长上下文基准和GSM8K上，FP16 KV缓存大小减少87.5%，支持1-bit量化，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CommVQ方法显著降低内存占用，支持超长上下文推理，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: OMEGA是一个新的数学问题评估基准，旨在测试大型语言模型（LLMs）在三种不同泛化轴上的表现：探索性、组合性和转化性。实验显示，前沿LLMs在问题复杂性增加时性能显著下降，而微调后的模型在探索性泛化上有所提升，但在组合性和转化性泛化上表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在数学推理中依赖有限的策略，难以应对需要新颖思维的问题。OMEGA旨在系统评估这些局限性，推动LLMs实现真正的数学创造力。

Method: 通过程序化生成训练-测试对，覆盖多个数学领域，并验证解决方案。评估前沿LLMs和微调模型在三种泛化轴上的表现。

Result: 前沿LLMs在复杂问题中性能下降；微调模型在探索性泛化上有提升，但在组合性和转化性泛化上改进有限。

Conclusion: OMEGA为LLMs在数学创造力方面的进步提供了基础，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

Motivation: 现有PRMs主要基于模型最终输出训练，难以稳健评估中间推理轨迹，尤其是在前沿推理模型生成的轨迹-响应输出中。

Method: 引入ReasonFlux-PRM，结合步级和轨迹级监督，支持离线和在线奖励监督，包括数据选择、强化学习和测试时扩展。

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM在多种任务中表现优异，为资源受限场景提供了高效版本，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

Method: 通过系统干预实验，分析了2,000张合成图像和2,000张CelebA面部图像，测量计算复杂性和注意力模式。

Result: 发现真实面部处理需要更高计算复杂度（1.084±0.008），并识别了八种功能不同的注意力机制（如边缘检测、纹理分析等）。干预实验显示性能下降25.6%至128.3%。

Conclusion: 研究为生成模型行为的算法理解和控制提供了定量基础，支持通过机制干预策略优化模型性能。

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

Conclusion: SRKD框架在现实部署场景中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at

Motivation: 阿拉斯加土壤测绘对生态和基础设施至关重要，但传统方法效率低，需更高效工具应对气候变化带来的挑战。

Method: MISO结合地理空间基础模型、隐式神经表示和对比学习，实现连续空间预测和多模态对齐。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证中表现优于随机森林，泛化能力更强，召回率更高。

Conclusion: MISO展示了先进机器学习在土壤测绘中的潜力，为未来规划和采样提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Conclusion: 该框架模块化设计、可解释性强，适合动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

Motivation: 随着老龄化加剧，浴室成为老年人跌倒的高发环境。现有单模态系统因环境干扰和系统偏差导致准确性不足，亟需一种隐私保护且高效的多模态解决方案。

Conclusion: P2MFDS为老年人浴室跌倒检测提供了一种隐私保护且高效的多模态解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

### [288] [A Novel Multi-layer Task-centric and Data Quality Framework for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17346)
*Yuhan Zhou,Haihua Chen,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种以任务为中心、数据质量为基础的五层框架，用于下一代自动驾驶车辆（AVs），旨在通过数据质量（DQ）与任务需求和性能目标的映射，提升AV的功能性、效率和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AV领域的研究和实践过于关注模型和算法，而忽视了数据质量的重要性。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过提升DQ来增强AV的适应性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了一个五层框架（数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层），并通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究验证了冗余数据对YOLOv8目标检测任务性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明，部分去除多源图像数据的冗余可以提升目标检测性能，同时揭示了图像和LiDAR数据中存在的冗余DQ问题。

Conclusion: 本文为AV领域提出了一个新颖的DQ框架，为构建更智能、适应性更强的AV系统提供了方向，并呼吁社区关注DQ与任务性能的关系。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组的高效反馈门网络（EFGN），用于单幅高光谱图像超分辨率（SHSR），通过反馈和门操作提升空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SHSR方法未能充分利用波段间和空间-光谱信息的连贯性，限制了性能。

Method: 采用大核卷积和光谱交互的反馈门操作，通过SPDFM模块学习丰富的波段信息和层次化空间信息，并设计了SSRGM模块增强空间-光谱特征。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上验证了方法在光谱保真度和空间内容重建上的优越性。

Conclusion: EFGN在SHSR任务中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了空间分辨率和光谱保真度。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

### [290] [From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374)
*Muhammad Tayyab Khan,Lequn Chen,Zane Yong,Jun Ming Tan,Wenhe Feng,Seung Ki Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合旋转感知目标检测模型和视觉语言解析器的混合框架，用于高效提取2D工程图中的关键信息，并在实验中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的关键信息效率低且不可靠，通用OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv11-OBB模型定位注释并提取定向边界框（OBB）补丁，再通过微调的轻量级视觉语言模型（VLM）解析为结构化输出。

Result: Donut模型在实验中表现优于Florence-2，达到88.5%的精确率、99.2%的召回率和93.5%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该框架在提取结构化信息方面表现出色，并支持下游制造任务，展示了其在现代化2D图纸解读中的实用价值。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为STPT的自监督学习方法，用于解决胚胎发育视频中长视频和时序不一致的挑战，显著提升了IVF胚胎存活率预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标记数据有限且传统自监督学习方法难以处理胚胎发育视频的长时序和语义不对齐问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: STPT分为空间和时间两个阶段，分别训练一个编码器并冻结另一个，以减少内存需求，并通过视频内对齐和时序建模解决语义不对齐问题。

Result: 在23,027个视频（3,286个标记）上，STPT的AUC达到0.635，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: STPT能高效处理长视频和时序变化，为IVF胚胎存活率预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Mamba RNN（VMRNN）和状态空间模型（SSM）的方法，结合不对称模块，显著提升了乳腺癌风险预测性能，尤其在长期时间点和高密度乳腺病例中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球主要死因之一，现有筛查方法多依赖单次检测，而临床实践表明利用时间动态信息能更准确预测风险。

Method: 采用VMRNN与SSM结合LSTM机制捕捉乳腺组织动态变化，并引入不对称模块（SAD和LAT）识别双侧差异。

Result: 在长期时间点（第4、5年）和高密度乳腺病例中预测性能显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动早期乳腺癌识别和个性化筛查策略的发展。

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合CNN和Transformer的混合模型Trans-CBCT，用于稀疏视图CBCT重建，并通过改进的Trans$^2$-CBCT进一步提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏视图CBCT重建中因采样不足导致的伪影和空间覆盖不足问题。

Method: 1. 使用TransUNet替代传统UNet/ResNet编码器，结合CNN的局部细节捕捉和Transformer的全局上下文增强。2. 引入邻居感知的Point Transformer模块，通过3D位置编码和k近邻注意力提升空间一致性。

Result: 在LUNA16数据集上，Trans-CBCT比基线方法PSNR提升1.17 dB，SSIM提升0.0163；Trans$^2$-CBCT进一步提升了0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征与基于点的几何推理，有效提升了稀疏视图CBCT重建的性能。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous

response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Conclusion: 提出的线性探针是一种高效且鲁棒的基线方法，适用于具有挑战性的场景。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: SCA-T为医学VLMs的迁移学习提供了一种更可靠的解决方案，适用于多种图像模态和任务。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

TL;DR: Scene-R1是一个基于视频的框架，通过强化学习和两阶段定位流程，无需3D实例监督即可理解3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知大语言模型依赖预训练检测器且不透明，Scene-R1旨在提供透明、高效的3D场景理解。

Method: 结合强化学习驱动的推理和两阶段定位（时间定位和图像定位），利用SAM2生成像素级掩码并投影到3D。

Result: Scene-R1在多个数据集上超越现有基线，提供透明推理路径，且无需密集3D标注。

Conclusion: 强化学习与RGB-D视频结合为可信赖的3D场景理解提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Motivation: 解决胶囊网络在监督任务中难以验证是否真正学习部分-整体层次结构的问题。

Method: 提出合成数据集SynDaCaTE，并通过实验验证现有胶囊模型的瓶颈和自注意力机制的有效性。

Result: 发现现有胶囊模型的瓶颈，并证明自注意力机制在部分-整体推理中高效。

Conclusion: SynDaCaTE为胶囊网络评估提供了工具，自注意力机制为未来计算机视觉的归纳偏置设计提供了方向。

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在任务规划和动作生成方面存在架构、规划和表示方法的多样性，难以明确性能提升的来源和改进方向。

Method: 引入VLA-OS统一架构，设计多维度控制实验，比较不同规划和表示方法的效果。

Result: 视觉基础规划表示优于语言表示；分层VLA范式在性能、泛化等方面表现更优，但训练和推理速度较慢。

Conclusion: 视觉基础规划和分层VLA范式是提升VLA模型性能的有效方法，但需权衡速度与性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMRG是一个基于联邦学习的框架，用于隐私保护的多中心LLM驱动的医学报告生成，解决了通信效率和数据异质性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像-报告数据分散且隐私敏感，集中化困难，阻碍了LLM驱动的医学报告生成模型的发展。

Method: 采用低秩分解减少通信开销，结合客户端感知对比学习和双适配器机制处理数据异质性。

Result: FedMRG在多中心数据中表现出良好的泛化性和适应性，生成临床准确的报告且通信高效。

Conclusion: FedMRG为隐私保护的多中心LLM医学报告生成提供了可行方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: HalluRNN通过架构级解决方案（DG-DPU模块）减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，仅需微调该模块即可在多任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在幻觉问题，即生成视觉上无根据的文本输出，现有方法通常需要大量资源或任务特定配置。

Method: 提出HalluRNN架构，采用双门深度传播单元（DG-DPU）模块，通过跨层循环推理增强模型稳定性。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块，HalluRNN在多个基准测试中表现出色且鲁棒。

Conclusion: HalluRNN提供了一种高效且资源友好的方法，显著减少了LVLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解行人及骑行者的短期运动意图对自动驾驶安全至关重要，但目前缺乏相关基准和方法。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X基准，包含多类意图标签和风险评估；提出SGG-Intent框架，结合视觉语言模型和场景图推理。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能显著提升意图预测和风险评估性能，尤其是显式建模上下文时。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X填补了意图预测基准的空白，SGG-Intent为自动驾驶决策提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SELFI框架，动态调节身份特征在深度伪造检测中的使用，提升跨操纵方法的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决身份特征在深度伪造检测中的矛盾观点，即是否应抑制或依赖身份特征。

Method: 提出SELFI框架，包括Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter（FAIA）和Identity-Aware Fusion Module（IAFM），动态整合身份与视觉特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，SELFI平均AUC提升3.1%，在DFDC数据集上优于之前最佳方法6%。

Conclusion: 身份特征应被显式建模和动态控制，而非盲目抑制或依赖，SELFI框架验证了这一观点。

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Result: 建立了最大的多模态PD数据集，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了诊断准确性，并适用于移动设备部署。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Motivation: 开发一种能够应对人口统计学和技术差异的脑MRI年龄预测模型，同时具备可解释性。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合自监督预训练和伪3D T1加权MRI扫描，通过茎架构降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为3.65年，泛化能力强（MAE 3.54年），并发现脑年龄差与认知能力显著相关。

Conclusion: 模型融合多视角和体积信息，实现了高精度、可解释的脑年龄预测，并与神经退行性疾病关联。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust
to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and
Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages
self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes
pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates
brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在训练和推理时间上大幅减少，计算成本降低1.5倍FLOPs。

Conclusion: 浅层特征增强器能以较低成本实现与高分辨率特征相似的性能。

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Conclusion: JarvisArt为智能修图开辟了新途径，兼具用户友好性、泛化能力和精细控制能力。

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EVR中复杂指令多样性和长时序视频时空动态的挑战，弥补现有方法（LLMs忽略视觉细节，VLMs缺乏逐步推理能力）的不足。

Method: 提出CLiViS框架，利用LLMs进行高级任务规划，协调VLM驱动的开放世界视觉感知，通过动态认知地图迭代更新场景上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在处理长时序视觉依赖时效果显著。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过结合LLMs和VLMs的优势，有效提升了EVR任务的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了PatchHunter，一种无需优化的对抗性补丁攻击方法，针对立体深度估计（SDE）模型，具有更强的现实适用性和迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在现实场景中适用性有限，尤其是在立体深度估计领域。论文旨在设计一种物理可实现、场景自适应且具有迁移性的攻击方法。

Method: 提出了一个统一的攻击框架，覆盖立体匹配的四个核心阶段，并引入PatchHunter，一种基于强化学习的视觉模式搜索方法。

Result: PatchHunter在KITTI数据集、CARLA模拟器和真实车辆部署中表现优异，攻击成功率高且迁移性强。

Conclusion: PatchHunter为SDE模型的对抗攻击提供了更有效的解决方案，尤其在现实场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AMCN的新网络，用于解决少样本OOD检测问题，通过自适应多提示对比学习优化ID-OOD边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OOD检测方法需要大量IID样本训练，限制了实际应用。少样本OOD检测更具挑战性，且现有方法忽略了类间多样性。

Method: 提出AMCN网络，利用CLIP连接文本与图像，生成自适应提示（可学习ID提示、固定OOD提示和自适应OOD提示），并通过类阈值优化边界。

Result: 实验表明AMCN优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过自适应提示和边界优化，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual
relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the
framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

*Shuaiye Lu,Linjiang Zhou,Xiaochuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的MDSAM方法，通过动态调整注意力分配减少大视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在解码时对图像标记的敏感性导致幻觉问题，需一种无需额外训练的方法解决。

Method: MDSAM通过记忆和动态更新注意力模式，优化图像标记的注意力分配。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MDSAM有效减少幻觉并提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: MDSAM是一种适应性强的解决方案，无需额外训练即可减少幻觉。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

### [317] [CSDN: A Context-Gated Self-Adaptive Detection Network for Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17679)
*Wei Haolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的检测头CSDN，通过引入门控机制替代传统的自注意力和交叉注意力层，以更高效地利用CNN骨干网络的特征，提升目标检测的全局上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在目标检测中受限于有限的感受野，难以捕捉全局上下文信息，且DETR架构中的自注意力机制存在信息冗余问题。

Method: 提出CSDN，采用门控机制自适应选择和组合多注意力模式的特征维度和尺度信息。

Result: CSDN显著提升了检测精度，且仅需少量微调即可适配多种CNN检测器。

Conclusion: CSDN通过高效利用特征和自适应机制，解决了传统方法的局限性，为目标检测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SeqDG的领域泛化方法，通过利用动作序列的一致性提升模型在未见环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决第一人称视角下动作识别模型在未见环境中性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合视觉-文本序列重建目标（SeqRec）和跨领域动作序列混合训练（SeqMix）。

Result: 在EPIC-KITCHENS-100上相对平均提升2.4%，在EGTEA上Top-1准确率提升0.6%。

Conclusion: SeqDG通过动作序列的上下文信息有效提升了模型在跨领域和领域内的动作识别性能。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉方法依赖大量标注数据和独立模态架构，计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 采用自监督学习框架，结合对比学习和掩码数据建模，使用共享视觉Transformer骨干网络处理多模态输入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无标注数据下表现优异，计算成本低于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在计算效率和模态缺失鲁棒性方面具有优势，适用于多模态输入场景。

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs
compared to traditional approaches.

*Bo Pan,Yang Chen,Yingwei Pan,Ting Yao,Wei Chen,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamJourney提出了一种两阶段框架，利用视频扩散模型生成动态场景的长期视频，解决了现有方法在3D感知和动态对象运动方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于2D扩散模型，缺乏3D感知能力且无法处理动态对象运动，导致生成视频存在失真和静态场景限制。

Method: DreamJourney分为两阶段：阶段I通过3D点云和视频扩散模型生成跨视图一致的视频；阶段II利用多模态大语言模型描述对象运动并生成动态视频。

Result: 实验表明，DreamJourney在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamJourney通过结合3D感知和动态对象运动，实现了高质量的长期动态场景视频生成。

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通过自然语言指令精确控制3D房间网格生成和编辑的挑战。

Method: 将任务分解为多个步骤（如生成3D坐标、全景图像、整合网格和纹理、家具布置），并利用视觉编程（VP）和扩散模型统一处理。

Result: 展示了框架的灵活性，并在定量和定性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Programmable-Room提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，通过自然语言指令生成和编辑3D房间网格。

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PDC-Net的新方法，用于从MRI图像中准确分割骨盆辐射损伤（PRI），通过多方向聚合模块和记忆引导上下文模块提升分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨盆辐射损伤（PRI）的准确分割对预后评估和个性化治疗计划至关重要，但自动化分割因器官形态复杂和上下文混淆而具有挑战性。

Method: 提出PDC-Net，包含多方向聚合模块（MDA）和记忆引导上下文模块（MGC），并通过自适应融合解码器（AFD）动态选择特征。

Result: 在首个大规模骨盆辐射损伤数据集上验证，PDC-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDC-Net通过分而治之的策略和模块化设计，显著提升了PRI分割的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

TL;DR: YOLOv13提出了一种基于超图的自适应相关性增强机制（HyperACE）和全流程聚合与分配范式（FullPAD），显著提升了复杂场景下的目标检测性能，同时减少了参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有YOLO系列模型在全局多对多高阶相关性建模方面存在不足，限制了复杂场景下的检测性能。

Method: 提出HyperACE机制和FullPAD范式，结合深度可分离卷积，优化网络结构。

Result: 在MS COCO基准测试中，YOLOv13-N的mAP比YOLO11-N和YOLOv12-N分别提升3.0%和1.5%。

Conclusion: YOLOv13在保持轻量化的同时，实现了更高的检测精度，为实时目标检测提供了新方案。

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N
improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and
models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临高维度、频带冗余和标注样本稀缺的挑战，现有变换器模型在标签稀缺条件下的扩展性和适应性有限。

Method: 结合3D卷积光谱前端和局部窗口自注意力，集成低秩适应（LoRA）以减少可训练参数，并使用循环学习率调度器优化训练。

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT为农业、环境监测和遥感分析中的高光谱图像应用提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

TL;DR: FairMoE框架通过动态路由数据到专家模块，在保持公平性的同时提升皮肤疾病诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在皮肤疾病诊断中存在对特定人群的偏见，导致不公平的医疗结果和患者信任度下降。传统方法试图消除敏感属性与预测的关联，但会损失临床相关诊断线索。

Method: 提出FairMoE框架，采用分层混合专家模块作为群体特定学习器，动态路由数据到最适合的专家，尤其适用于处理群体边界附近的情况。

Result: 实验表明，FairMoE在保持公平性指标的同时显著提升了诊断准确性，优于传统公平性方法。

Conclusion: FairMoE提供了一种有效的方法，既能减少偏见，又能提高诊断性能，适用于医疗AI系统。

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流ICL方法依赖网格策略，缺乏视觉应用的灵活性，限制了上下文图像的数量和分辨率。

Method: 提出Temporal方法，通过自监督学习预训练提示检索器，将ICL任务转化为VOS问题，支持可变数量的上下文图像并保持其完整分辨率。

Result: 在MICCAI FLARE 2022上，图像分割Dice分数提升10.64%（90.95%），视频分割提升14.88%（92.45%）。

Conclusion: Temporal方法显著提升了ICL在视觉任务中的性能，解决了网格方法的限制。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积稀疏表示（CSR）的前景-背景分离（FBS）方法，解决了现有方法在低帧率和噪声视频中分离不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在硬件、环境和电源限制等不良条件下获取的视频中，动态和静态组件的分析需要一种能够处理低帧率和多种噪声的FBS方法。现有方法无法准确分离前景和背景，因为它们要么仅捕捉特定数据特征，要么缺乏明确的噪声模型。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在红外和显微镜视频中优于现有方法，能够准确分离前景和背景并去除多种噪声。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合数据特定和通用特征，以及显式噪声模型，显著提升了在低帧率和噪声视频中的前景-背景分离性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SMPL的3D胎儿统计身体模型，用于改进胎儿MRI分析中的形状和运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如关键点或体积分割）在胎儿MRI分析中存在局限性：关键点忽略细节，分割难以处理运动。

Method: 构建3D胎儿统计模型，迭代估计图像空间中的姿势和规范姿势空间中的形状。

Result: 模型在测试中表面对齐误差为3.2 mm（3 mm体素），并支持自动人体测量。

Conclusion: 该模型首次实现了3D胎儿统计建模，为产前诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

TL;DR: CM-SSM是一种高效的RGB-热语义分割架构，通过跨模态状态空间建模（SSM）方法，显著降低了计算开销，并在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多源数据处理（如基于Transformer的方法）在资源受限系统中计算开销大的问题。

Method: 提出CM-SSM架构，包含跨模态2D选择性扫描（CM-SS2D）模块和跨模态状态空间关联（CM-SSA）模块，实现线性计算复杂度。

Result: 在CART和PST900数据集上达到最先进性能，参数更少，计算成本更低。

Conclusion: CM-SSM是一种高效且通用的RGB-热语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are
available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型（Vid-LLMs）在手术视频的精细理解任务上存在不足，需要专门模型来捕捉复杂的手术过程细节。

Method: 提出SurgVidLM模型，使用SVU-31K数据集训练，引入StageFocus机制和Multi-frequency Fusion Attention技术。

Result: SurgVidLM在全面和精细手术视频理解任务中显著优于现有Vid-LLMs。

Conclusion: SurgVidLM填补了手术视频精细理解领域的空白，展示了其在复杂手术场景中的卓越能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

Result: 实验验证了StainPIDR和模板选择算法的有效性，表明该方法在染色归一化任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: StainPIDR能有效解决病理图像颜色差异问题，代码将公开。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

Abstract: Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite
imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring,
disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a
Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature
fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free
optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature
fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data.
Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss
weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction
accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of
0.017. These outcomes highlight the framework's effectiveness in producing
high-fidelity, spatially and spectrally consistent cloud-free optical images.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在建模场景特征与查询特征的外部关系时，缺乏对场景特征内部及查询特征间关系的有效建模。

Method: 提出自适应超点聚合模块和对比学习引导的超点优化模块，增强场景特征表示；引入关系感知自注意力机制，结合位置和几何关系优化查询特征间的关系建模。

Result: 在ScanNetV2、ScanNet++、ScanNet200和S3DIS数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: Relation3D通过改进关系建模，显著提升了3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Conclusion: 本文的数据集和方法为传送带裂缝检测领域提供了重要资源和技术支持。

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内中心视觉对AR、VR和机器人应用至关重要，但现有方法依赖2D线索、多视角同步设置和不现实的假设。

Method: EgoWorld通过估计外中心深度图重建点云，再将其重投影到内中心视角，并应用扩散修复生成密集、语义一致的内中心图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，适用于新对象、动作、场景和主体，甚至在无标签真实数据上也有效。

Conclusion: EgoWorld为内中心视觉重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

TL;DR: MMGrounded-PostAlign框架通过视觉和文本基础模块提升MLLMs的视觉理解能力，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在视觉语言任务中过度依赖虚假相关性和语言先验的问题。

Method: 引入多模态基础模块（视觉和文本基础）和负拒绝机制，结合选择性推理策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和幻觉抑制能力。

Conclusion: MMGrounded-PostAlign有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解能力并减少了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CEDO的新框架，通过三种机制（MHO、GMS、DLR）从因果和效应角度全面减少医学视觉问答模型中的语言偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉问答模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别之间建立了虚假关联。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动的异构优化）、GMS（梯度引导的模态协同）和DLR（分布适应的损失重缩放），分别从不同角度减少偏差。

Result: 在多个传统和偏差敏感基准测试中，CEDO表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO通过综合优化机制有效减少了语言偏差，提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming

Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多模态生成任务中表现优异，但在文本到运动生成中与非LLM方法存在显著性能差距，主要因运动标记化的粒度问题。

Method: 提出PlanMoGPT框架，结合渐进式规划和流增强的细粒度运动标记化，通过分层生成运动标记和优化解码器恢复运动细节。

Result: 在文本到运动基准测试中，FID分数提升63.8%，运动多样性增加49.9%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT成功解决了多样性-质量的权衡问题，为文本到运动生成设定了新标准。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

Result: 在Office-Home、Office-31和VisDA-2017数据集上优于现有CNN方法，在DomainNet上表现相当。

Conclusion: 该方法通过架构和损失函数的优化，显著提升了域自适应的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The

*Azamat Ibragimov,Ruslan Isaev,Remudin Reshid Mekuria,Gulnaz Gimaletdinova,Dim Shaiakhmetov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的深度学习模型，用于分类街头集市中的帐篷，比较了自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0的性能，结果显示EfficientNetB0表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街头集市是许多地区的重要经济中心，但其非结构化特性使得帐篷等市场基础设施的自动分类具有挑战性。手动方法效率低下，因此需要更高效的自动分类方法。

Method: 研究使用自定义CNN和EfficientNetB0模型，基于126张原始照片及其增强数据集进行分类任务，并通过多种性能指标评估模型。

Result: 自定义CNN达到92.8%的准确率，而EfficientNetB0达到98.4%，表明迁移学习在分类任务中更有效。

Conclusion: 预训练模型（如EfficientNetB0）能显著提高分类准确率和泛化能力，适用于集市图像分类任务。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

TL;DR: 新开发的移动应用利用ARCore和机器学习算法（如DeepLabv3）改进Mantoux皮肤测试（TST），解决传统方法的主观性和低随访率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TST方法存在主观性、低随访率和误诊问题，尤其在资源有限地区影响结核病管理。

Method: 应用结合ARCore和DeepLabv3进行图像分割，使用边缘检测算法提高测量精度，并通过标尺贴纸作为参考。

Result: 与标准临床实践相比，应用显著提高了准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该应用自动化并标准化TST评估，提升了结核病诊断的效率和可及性，未来将优化算法和扩展功能。

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合4D雷达运动状态和跨模态不确定性的LiDAR检测框架，以解决雷达与LiDAR之间的不对齐问题，并提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR和4D雷达在自动驾驶中各有优势，但跨模态不对齐问题常被忽视，需结合两者优势提升感知能力。

Method: 使用动态运动感知编码模块提取4D雷达的运动信息，并通过估计边界框的不确定性来减少跨模态不对齐，优化LiDAR预测。

Result: 在VoD数据集上表现优异，整体区域mAP达74.89%，驾驶走廊内达88.70%，实时推理速度为30.02 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨模态不对齐问题，实现了高性能的实时感知。

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IQA方法多采用线性融合多尺度特征，未能充分捕捉失真对语义内容的影响。

Method: 利用CLIP模型，设计多尺度交叉注意力模块，结合40个图像质量形容词，增强图像质量与人类语言的关联。

Result: 在多个FR和NR IQA基准测试中表现优异，且更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BPCLIP通过结合多尺度特征和语言模型，显著提升了图像质量评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过最大化多样性保护隐私的合成数据生成框架，性能接近真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在医学影像中具有隐私保护潜力，但现有方法在合法性和性能上存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的通用框架，生成非个人化合成数据。

Result: 合成数据性能接近真实数据（相差1个百分点），优于现有非隐私保护方法。

Conclusion: 通过最大化多样性实现隐私保护，同时提升合成数据的实用性。

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Abstract: Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without

costs compared to traditional systems. However, these advantages often come at
the expense of higher computational demands and slower inference, limiting
their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this technical report, we
present a fast and reliable neural inverse kinematics framework designed for
real-time capture of human body motions from 3D keypoints. We describe the
network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail.
Our framework is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, and we
support key design decisions through ablation studies.

Conclusion: OSDMamba通过结合Mamba和优化解码器设计，显著提升了油污检测的精度，尤其在处理小面积油污和类别不平衡时表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and
code will be released.

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized
inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost
on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into
layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex
reasoning. The source code and pre-trained model are available at

Motivation: 解决WSI中组织分布分散和跨区域空间交互难以建模的问题。

Result: 在九个大型癌症数据集上的实验显示MiCo优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiCo有效增强了WSI分析中的跨区域组织关联，性能优越。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: LLM的语义感知能力可有效迁移至视觉任务，提升全局理解和局部建模能力，且对不同LLM（如LLaMA、DeepSeek）均有效。

Abstract: With the advancement of Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language
processing, this paper presents an intriguing finding: a frozen pre-trained LLM
layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our

awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global

Method: CmFNet包含模态特定特征学习网络、跨模态特征学习网络和混合监督学习策略，整合多模态信息并优化特征对齐。

Result: 在NPC和WORD数据集上优于现有弱监督方法，甚至优于全监督方法。

Conclusion: CmFNet有效提升分割性能，适用于临床治疗，对多领域专家有益。

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型视觉语言模型（SVLMs）因参数规模小（≤2B）而成本低，但推理能力受限。本文旨在通过优化训练策略提升其性能。

Method: 1. 构建自监督COT数据；2. 分四阶段训练：SFT注入知识、GRPO对齐格式、GRPO增强推理、CLGRPO约束训练空间。

Result: 在EMOSet-118K数据集上，1B SVLM的准确率提升2.77，召回率提升0.69，性能接近8B模型。

Conclusion: 增量训练策略有效提升了SVLMs的推理能力，使其在低成本下达到更高性能。

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在处理复杂几何形状（如小麦穗）时表现优于传统几何方法，形状对体积预测准确性有显著影响。

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: MUPA是一种多路径协作方法，用于解决Grounded VideoQA问题，通过结合视频定位、问答、答案反思和聚合，显著提高了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态模型依赖语言先验和虚假相关性，导致预测结果缺乏视觉证据支持。

Method: 提出MUPA方法，包含三个推理路径和一个反思代理，统一处理视频定位和问答任务。

Result: MUPA在2B参数下优于7B规模的竞争对手，7B参数时在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上达到30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA。

Conclusion: MUPA在视频-语言理解中表现出高效性和可信性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多任务学习中存在单模态限制和低效架构问题，无法满足驾驶辅助的全面场景理解和实时部署需求。

Method: 提出两阶段架构：MTS-Mamba子网络提取时空特征，MGMI模块自适应整合多模态特征。

Result: 在AIDE数据集上实现所有四项任务的最优精度，模型轻量且推理速度达142.32 FPS。

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning通过高效特征提取和模态整合，显著提升多任务学习性能，适用于实时驾驶辅助。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Motivation: 当前领先的多模态生成模型如GPT-4o-Image是专有的，限制了研究发展。作者希望通过开源数据和模型推动开放研究。

Method: 利用GPT-4o生成的数据集（45K文本到图像和46K文本与图像结合数据），训练Janus-4o模型，支持两种生成任务。

Conclusion: 开源ShareGPT-4o-Image数据集和Janus-4o模型将促进多模态生成领域的开放研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了VICReg在自监督学习中的潜在不足，提出改进方法SAG-VICReg，增强泛化能力，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg可能因过度依赖训练数据而泛化能力不足，需改进以提升对未见数据的表现。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg，通过新训练技术增强全局语义捕捉和泛化能力。

Result: SAG-VICReg在泛化能力和全局语义理解上优于现有方法，同时保持局部指标竞争力。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg有效解决泛化问题，并提出无需标签的新评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Motivation: 医学影像诊断存在疾病模拟正常解剖结构和患者间差异大的挑战，现有医学VLMs缺乏比较推理机制，而通用VLMs缺乏医学领域知识。

Method: 利用查询图像和匹配的参考图像，结合临床启发的比较提示，对通用VLMs进行监督微调（SFT）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了比较分析在医学诊断中的临床意义，提出了利用参考图像的新策略，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

Motivation: 传统方法在波长、尺寸或相关性上难以实现两相流的相位分离，因此探索基于图像模式的CNN方法。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN和YOLOv4等CNN模型，通过生成对抗网络生成标记数据，训练模型识别散焦图像中的相位特征。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，检测精度和分类准确率达95-100%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CNN方法在传统方法不适用的情况下，为两相流相位分离提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

Motivation: 解决密集对应学习中手动标注繁琐且不可扩展的问题，以及现有自监督方法训练数据不足的挑战。

Method: 通过图像条件扩散模型生成多样合成视图，采用多锚点策略调整预训练任务难度。

Result: CDG-MAE显著优于仅依赖图像的MAE方法，并缩小了与基于视频方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: CDG-MAE通过合成视图和多锚点策略，为密集对应学习提供了高效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

Conclusion: STACT-Time模型通过减少不必要的活检并保持高敏感性，有望改善临床决策和患者预后。

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Conclusion: DExNet在小样本条件下表现出色，显著减少数据需求，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM在复杂环境中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our

TL;DR: DINO-enhanced NeRF模型在极端少样本场景下表现不如基线NeRF，PSNR值更低，表明预训练视觉特征可能对少样本3D重建无益甚至有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练视觉特征（如DINO）在少样本3D重建中的有效性，尤其是在极端少样本场景下。

Method: 系统评估DINO增强的NeRF模型，包括基线NeRF、冻结DINO特征、LoRA微调特征和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 所有DINO变体PSNR值（12.9-13.0）均低于基线NeRF（14.71），表明预训练特征可能引入有害偏差。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉特征可能不适合少样本3D重建，建议关注几何一致性的简单架构。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

Method: 采用沙漏网络和注意力门结构，自动定位100多个膝关节解剖标志点，测量解剖胫股角。

Result: 与临床测量相比，平均绝对差异约1度，术前ICC为0.97，术后为0.86。

Conclusion: 该方法能高精度自动化膝关节对齐评估，提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级、边缘设备可部署的视网膜疾病分类器，通过跨架构知识蒸馏方法，将高性能ViT教师模型压缩为CNN学生模型，适用于资源有限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源有限的地区，缺乏可靠的视网膜疾病诊断设备，因此需要开发一种轻量级且高效的分类器。

Method: 使用I-JEPA自监督学习预训练ViT教师模型，然后通过包含PCA投影器、GL投影器和多视图鲁棒训练方法的新框架，将其压缩为CNN学生模型。

Result: 学生模型参数比教师模型少97.4%，分类准确率达89%，保留了教师模型93%的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了ViT模型的压缩并保持准确性，为资源有限地区提供了可扩展的AI驱动视网膜疾病分类解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型在长上下文推理时存在内存和计算延迟问题，需优化注意力机制以提升效率。

Method: 提出ADSA方法，动态识别关键历史令牌以优化注意力计算，并引入动态KV缓存更新机制减少内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，内存消耗降低约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA有效解决了长上下文推理中的资源问题，为文本到图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: Drive-R1是一个专为自动驾驶设计的视觉语言模型，通过结合场景推理和运动规划，解决了现有模型依赖历史信息和推理与规划不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中过度依赖历史信息，且推理过程与规划结果不匹配，Drive-R1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Drive-R1通过监督微调和强化学习框架，逐步推理视觉输入到规划决策，并优化推理路径。

Result: 在nuScenes和DriveLM-nuScenes基准测试中，Drive-R1表现优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Drive-R1为自动驾驶中的推理与规划结合提供了新方向，具有未来研究和应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Result: CLARE在REIR任务上达到SOTA性能，并能泛化到TIR和REC任务。

Conclusion: REIR任务和CLARE方法有效解决了实例级检索和定位的需求，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: 通过语义结构感知攻击框架，显著提升了对抗扰动的迁移性和效率。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法有效利用了多分辨率信息和伪标签优化，显著提升了弱监督时间动作定位的准确性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering
(VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation
capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed
approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the
improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations.
Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise

Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly

and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

TL;DR: 论文提出SpuriVerse基准，用于研究多模态大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的虚假相关性，发现即使顶级模型表现不佳，但通过针对性微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实场景中LVLMs因虚假相关性导致的错误，弥补现有基准在任务多样性和真实性上的不足。

Method: 利用GPT-4o错误数据构建SpuriVerse基准，包含124类虚假相关性，并通过合成反事实评估筛选样本。

Result: 15个LVLMs在SpuriVerse上表现不佳（最高37.1%准确率），但微调后提升至78.40%。

Conclusion: 模型通过多样化虚假模式训练能避免‘捷径’学习，更关注整体图像上下文。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Result: 在多个任务基准测试中表现优异，尤其在上下文生成任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: OmniGen2是一个高效且多功能的生成模型，其开源资源将支持未来研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LucentVisionNet是一种零样本学习框架，用于低光图像增强，结合多尺度空间注意力和深度曲线估计网络，在保持语义和感知保真度的同时实现精细增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强任务中缺乏配对训练数据的挑战，超越传统和深度学习方法。

Method: 集成多尺度空间注意力与深度曲线估计网络，采用循环增强策略，并使用包含六个定制组件的复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有监督、无监督和零样本方法，实现高视觉质量、结构一致性和计算效率。

Conclusion: LucentVisionNet适用于移动摄影、监控和自主导航等实际应用。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态框架，将视觉理解和生成统一在一个共享的离散语义表示中，核心是文本对齐的分词器（TA-Tok），通过扩展的词汇表实现跨模态输入输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过统一的离散语义表示，消除视觉和文本模态之间的鸿沟，避免模态特定设计的需求。

Method: 使用文本对齐的分词器（TA-Tok）将图像转换为离散标记，并结合两种互补的解码器（自回归模型和扩散模型）实现高效生成。

Result: 实验表明，Tar在多模态LLM任务中表现优异，收敛更快且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了视觉和文本的统一表示，为多模态任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptSan方法，通过两种变体（PromptSan-Modify和PromptSan-Suffix）净化有害文本提示，减少T2I模型生成有害内容，同时保持生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion）的快速发展带来了生成有害内容的风险，PromptSan旨在解决这一问题，促进技术的可持续发展。

Method: PromptSan包括两种方法：1）PromptSan-Modify通过迭代识别和替换有害标记；2）PromptSan-Suffix训练优化的后缀标记序列中和有害意图。

Result: 实验表明，PromptSan在多指标上显著减少有害内容生成，平衡了安全性和可用性。

Conclusion: PromptSan是一种无需修改模型架构的有效方法，为T2I技术的安全应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型生成的内容可能不符合人类主观偏好或任务需求，且缺乏对3D结构的理解。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的可微分偏好学习框架，通过几何感知的奖励函数反向传播人类偏好。

Result: 框架通过四种几何感知奖励函数，实现了更可控和可解释的高质量3D内容生成。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于自然语言的高质量3D内容生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，现有方法在染色和形态变化下特征提取不足，且端到端方法在样本有限的数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一种架构，捕获多尺度局部和全局上下文信息，并采用新型解码器设计，有效整合编码器特征，强调重要通道和区域。

Result: 在四个数据集上实验表明，方法优于现有SOTA方法，性能提升显著（如MoNuSeg提升2.76%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进特征整合和解码器设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性。

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSMamba是一种新型视觉Mamba架构，通过亮度Mamba和语义Mamba组件，解决了低光图像增强中亮度提升与语义一致性保持的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法在提升亮度的同时难以保持语义一致性和细节，且传统视觉Mamba方法因固定扫描规则限制了远距离令牌的交互。

Method: 提出BSMamba架构，包含亮度Mamba（基于亮度相似性交互）和语义Mamba（基于语义相似性交互），优化令牌交互模式。

Result: 实验表明BSMamba在低光图像增强任务中达到最先进性能，同时保持语义一致性。

Conclusion: BSMamba通过亮度与语义引导的令牌交互，突破了传统方法的限制，实现了高效且语义一致的低光图像增强。

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 结合频域和空间域信息的方法在小样本学习中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

Motivation: 在医疗监控、工作场所安全等应用中，检测异常人体行为至关重要，异常常表现为不寻常的姿势。

Method: 通过自回归因子分解建模骨骼序列密度，利用条件高斯分布预测关键点位置，低密度标记为异常。

Result: 在UBnormal、MSAD-HR数据集上表现最优，在ShanghaiTech数据集上竞争力强。

Conclusion: SeeKer方法简单高效，显著提升了异常检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

Result: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs的视觉识别和个性化生成能力，在多概念图像描述任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RL后训练框架为MLLMs的个性化图像描述生成提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view
and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting
19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于其他分布式多目标滤波器。

Conclusion: 通过近似和闭式解，实现了高效的分布式多目标滤波，并展示了其优越性。

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

Result: 方法在区分良性痣和黑色素瘤上表现优异，潜在空间支持可视化和几何解释。

Conclusion: 该方法结合预测性能和临床适用性，提升AI辅助诊断的可信度和早期检测能力。

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在图像修复中表现出色，尤其在保留高频细节和降低计算成本方面具有优势。

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

Conclusion: CPAM通过创新模块和策略，实现了高质量、背景保留的图像编辑。

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Result: DIP在多种下游场景理解任务中表现优异，计算效率高（单A100 GPU不到9小时）。

Conclusion: DIP提供了一种实用且有效的方法，显著提升了密集图像表示的性能。

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，智能代理需在动态数据流中处理用户查询，但查询与支持证据通常异步到达，这要求代理具备时间感知和记忆能力。

Result: 实验表明，AViLA在准确性和时间感知上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: AViLA为解决查询-证据异步问题提供了有效方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了通过扰动查询上下文生成强监督信号的重要性。

Method: 结合教师-学生学习和伪标签生成，利用强增强样本和预测一致性作为标签置信度。

Result: CCL在实验中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CCL框架通过上下文一致性学习有效提升了半监督视频段落定位的性能。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: HER2match数据集和模型比较为相关研究提供了高质量数据和指导。

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Result: 实验和用户研究表明ShowFlow在广告和虚拟试衣等应用中效果显著。

Conclusion: ShowFlow为可控图像合成提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在长尾数据分布中表现不佳，教师模型对头部类别有偏见，尾部类别监督不足。

Method: 将标准KD目标分解为组间和组内KL散度，引入重平衡的组间损失和均匀的组内损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上，LTKD优于现有KD方法，整体准确率和尾部类别性能均有显著提升。

Conclusion: LTKD能有效从有偏见的教师模型中转移知识，适用于资源受限和不平衡的实际场景。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of
current and future multimodal researches.

dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature

Conclusion: TEAFormer通过自适应滑动索引和组件堆叠策略，成功解决了翻译等变性问题，提升了图像修复任务的性能。

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be
released at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR.

Conclusion: HS2SD能更细致地建模双曲集合间的层次和复杂关系。

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Result: 在标准图像分类、层次分类和少样本学习任务中表现优异，尤其在少样本学习任务中显著提升性能（mini-ImageNet上提升5%以上）。

Conclusion: 自适应距离度量能更好地捕捉多样化的层次结构，可视化显示更清晰的类边界和原型分离。

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

*Muhao Xu,Xueying Zhou,Xizhan Gao,Weiye Song,Guang Feng,Sijie Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多语义融合网络的无监督异常检测方法，通过引入正常样本的多语义特征来指导异常重建，显著提升了逻辑异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑异常检测比结构异常更具挑战性，现有方法通过低维瓶颈压缩输入，但逻辑异常的全局语义与正常模式差异显著，导致异常特征仍能通过瓶颈传播。

Method: 提出了一种多语义融合网络，利用预训练的视觉语言网络提取正常样本的全局语义，并通过向量量化构建可学习的语义码本，将多语义特征融合后输入解码器。

Result: 在MVTec LOCO AD数据集上，该方法在pixel-sPRO和image-AUROC指标上分别提升了5.7%和2.6%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入正常样本的多语义特征，该方法有效解决了逻辑异常检测中的瓶颈问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

*Sung Jin Um,Dongjin Kim,Sangmin Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的音频-视觉声源定位框架，通过生成详细上下文信息区分发声物体与静默物体，并引入两种新损失函数（OCA和ORI），显著提升了复杂场景中的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确定位发声物体，尤其是当视觉相似的静默物体共存时，主要因其依赖简单的音频-视觉对应关系，无法捕捉语义差异。

Method: 利用MLLMs生成区分发声与静默物体的详细上下文信息，并设计OCA和ORI两种损失函数进行有效整合。

Result: 在MUSIC和VGG-Sound数据集上的实验表明，该方法在单源和多源定位场景中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结合MLLMs和新型损失函数，有效解决了复杂场景中的声源定位问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated
detailed contextual information are available at:

TL;DR: VQ-Insight是一种新型推理式视觉语言模型框架，用于评估AI生成视频的质量，通过渐进式学习和多维度评分奖励显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频质量评估存在泛化性差、缺乏时间意识、依赖标注数据等问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出VQ-Insight框架，结合图像质量预热、任务特定时间学习和联合优化，设计多维度评分奖励和偏好比较奖励。

Result: 实验表明VQ-Insight在多维度评分、偏好比较和自然视频评分上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: VQ-Insight为视频生成任务提供了显著改进，解决了现有评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

TL;DR: VisualChef是一种生成烹饪场景上下文视觉辅助的方法，通过掩码视觉定位简化对齐，提升烹饪指导效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烹饪过程中缺乏一致的视觉指导，现有方法依赖复杂文本对齐，VisualChef旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 基于掩码视觉定位，识别动作相关对象并分类，生成动作执行和结果图像，保持环境一致。

Result: 在三个第一人称视频数据集上定量和定性评估，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisualChef通过简化视觉对齐，有效提升烹饪场景的视觉辅助生成质量。

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前基于3D高斯基元的可微渲染方法在重建高保真3D场景时仍面临渲染速度和高级渲染效果（如重光照和阴影渲染）的挑战。

Method: 提出2DTS方法，使用2D三角形面片替代3D高斯基元，结合紧凑性参数直接训练逼真网格。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未调优紧凑性参数的情况下，保真度优于现有高斯基元方法，且重建网格的视觉质量优于现有网格重建方法。

Conclusion: 2DTS方法在保留连续体积建模优势的同时，通过离散网格状结构提升了渲染效果和速度。

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重采样的对比自监督学习方法，用于卫星图像时间序列（SITS）的数据增强，显著提升了农业分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星图像时间序列（SITS）中未标记数据丰富而标记数据稀缺，对比自监督预训练成为利用未标记数据的有效工具，但设计适用于时间序列的数据增强方法仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的重采样增强策略，通过上采样时间序列并提取不相交的子序列，同时保留时间覆盖范围，生成正样本对。

Result: 在多个农业分类基准测试中，该方法优于常见的增强方法（如抖动、调整大小和掩码），并在S2-Agri100数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为遥感时间序列提供了一种简单而有效的对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

TL;DR: SpaNN是一种对抗性攻击检测器，其计算复杂度与对抗性补丁数量无关，通过构建二值化特征图集合并进行聚类检测攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单补丁攻击，对多补丁攻击效果不佳或计算效率低。

Method: SpaNN通过应用一组显著性阈值构建二值化特征图集合，进行聚类并使用聚类特征输入分类器检测攻击。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SpaNN在目标检测和图像分类任务中分别优于现有方法11和27个百分点。

Conclusion: SpaNN是一种高效且鲁棒的对抗性攻击检测方法，尤其适用于多补丁攻击场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Result: 在多个基准测试和人类评估中，RDPO在动作连贯性和物理真实性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: RDPO有效解决了物理一致性问题，为视频生成提供了更真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The
source code and demonstration of this paper are available at:

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the
necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界和类别不平衡的挑战，现有方法依赖局部线索或用户提示，缺乏语义先验，难以处理低对比度或重叠目标。

Method: MedSeg-R分为认知阶段和感知阶段：认知阶段从医学报告中提取结构化语义先验（位置、纹理、形状），感知阶段利用这些先验通过空间注意力、动态卷积和可变形采样优化SAM模型。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，MedSeg-R显著提高了重叠和模糊结构的分割准确性，表现出与SAM系统的即插即用兼容性。

Conclusion: MedSeg-R通过嵌入细粒度语义先验，有效解决了医学图像分割中的模糊边界和类别不平衡问题，提升了小病灶的检测灵敏度。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集推动了SLAM、3D重建及视觉基础模型的研究发展。

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on

Result: 在五个医学图像数据集上表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour是一种准确且稳健的临床分割工具。

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度光谱注意力模块（MSAM），通过结合不同核大小的1D卷积和自适应特征聚合机制，显著提升了高光谱图像（HSI）的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在自动驾驶环境感知中潜力巨大，但其高维光谱数据的高效处理仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MSAM模块，集成三种不同核大小的1D卷积，并结合自适应特征聚合机制，将其嵌入UNet的跳跃连接中（UNet-MSAM）。

Result: 在多个HSI数据集上，UNet-MSAM平均提升了3.61%的mIoU和3.80%的mF1，计算开销仅增加0.02%参数和0.82%GFLOPS。

Conclusion: 多尺度核组合优于单尺度配置，为自动驾驶中的HSI处理提供了高效的多尺度特征提取方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SIM-Net是一种新型2D图像分类架构，通过将RGB图像推断的3D点云表示与2D图像特征融合，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统图像分类模型在数字化植物标本分类中因背景复杂、遮挡等问题导致的性能不足。

Method: 通过像素到点的转换将2D对象掩码转为3D点云，结合CNN和PointNet编码器融合纹理与几何特征。

Result: 在植物标本数据集上，SIM-Net比ResNet101准确率提升9.9%，F-score提升12.3%，优于多种先进架构。

Conclusion: SIM-Net通过融合3D结构推理显著提升了2D图像分类性能，尤其在复杂背景和遮挡场景中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Matrix-Game为交互式图像到世界生成提供了高效解决方案，并开源模型和评测基准。

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive
image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights
and the GameWorld Score benchmark at https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Matrix-Game.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

TL;DR: 现代深度CNN人脸匹配器支持可撤销的生物识别方案，生成多个具有等效识别能力但模板不兼容的模型。ViT在此方案中表现不如ResNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物识别模板一旦泄露无法撤销的问题。

Method: 利用深度CNN生成多个等效但模板不兼容的模型，并测试ViT的适用性。

Result: 模型间模板不兼容，泄露模板无效；ViT表现不如ResNet。

Conclusion: 深度CNN支持可撤销生物识别，ViT不适用。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Abstract: Object tracking in inland waterways plays a crucial role in safe and

the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability
for autonomous driving in waterborne environments. The USVTrack dataset is

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）的新机制，通过将局部空间上下文融入注意力计算，改进了语义占用预测（SOP）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遮挡和数据稀疏性，自动驾驶中的感知系统难以获取完整的环境信息。现有的基于Transformer的SOP方法在注意力计算中缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致几何感知能力有限，在稀疏或遮挡区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种名为空间感知窗口注意力（SWA）的新机制，通过融入局部空间上下文改进注意力计算。

Result: SWA显著提升了场景完成度，并在LiDAR和相机两种模态的SOP基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，有效提升了语义占用预测的性能，具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖图像指标或几何测量，无法捕捉感知吸引力和实际效用，因此需要更符合人类偏好的评估方式。

Method: 利用成对比较收集人类偏好数据，结合统计欺诈检测和ELO排名系统进行模型评估。

Result: 收集了123,243票，发现高斯泼溅输出比网格模型有16.6 ELO优势，带纹理模型比无纹理模型有144.1 ELO优势。

Conclusion: 3D Arena成为生成3D模型评估的基准，推动了以人为中心的评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from
8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human
preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware
comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a
benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered
evaluation in Generative 3D.

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在计算资源、内存需求和任务迁移学习方面的挑战，尤其是自注意力机制的高计算复杂度问题。

Method: 引入SPPP生成语义丰富的补丁嵌入，结合LLA模块通过潜在令牌减少注意力机制的时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了计算效率，同时性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘部署提供了高效节能的Transformer解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Result: 在DyCheck基准测试中，ViDAR在视觉质量和几何一致性上优于现有方法，尤其在动态区域表现突出。

Conclusion: ViDAR通过扩散模型和几何对齐策略，显著提升了动态场景新视角合成的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过对象中心特征整合，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了语义占用预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and
fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).
On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized
model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it
the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Result: 实验表明，使用Phantom-Data训练显著提升指令对齐和视觉质量，同时保持身份一致性。

Conclusion: Phantom-Data为跨配对主题到视频生成提供了首个通用数据集，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出TAMMs模型，通过轻量级时间模块增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），用于卫星图像时间序列分析和未来场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在卫星图像时间序列分析中缺乏细粒度时空推理能力，难以处理复杂的多模态动态建模。

Method: TAMMs结合轻量级时间模块进行结构化序列编码和上下文提示，并引入语义融合控制注入（SFCI）机制，结合高级语义推理和结构先验，增强ControlNet以实现未来图像生成。

Result: 实验表明，TAMMs在时间变化理解和未来图像预测任务中优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 精心设计的时间推理和语义融合能充分发挥MLLMs在时空理解中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

TL;DR: OmniAvatar是一个创新的音频驱动全身视频生成模型，通过多层级音频嵌入策略和LoRA训练方法，提升了唇同步精度和自然动作，支持精确的文本控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注面部动作，难以生成自然同步的全身动画，且缺乏细粒度控制能力。

Method: 采用像素级多层级音频嵌入策略和LoRA训练方法，结合音频特征与基础模型的提示控制能力。

Result: 实验表明，OmniAvatar在面部和半身视频生成上优于现有模型，支持多种场景的精确控制。

Conclusion: OmniAvatar通过创新方法解决了音频驱动全身动画的挑战，实现了更自然的同步和细粒度控制。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

TL;DR: MVAA框架通过两步自动对齐视频与音乐节奏，保留原始内容，提升视觉流畅度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频与音乐节奏对齐在多媒体制作中需求大，但现有方法依赖人工或生成模型灵活性不足。

Method: MVAA分为两步：关键帧对齐音频节拍，节奏感知视频修复；采用预训练和快速微调策略。

Result: 实验表明MVAA能高质量对齐节奏并保持视觉流畅，适应时间短。

Conclusion: MVAA为视频音乐对齐提供高效灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用光度立体中光照与表面法线特征的深度耦合问题，以及复杂表面高频几何细节的准确捕捉。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果。

Conclusion: 通用光度立体仍需解决光照与法线特征的耦合及高频细节保留问题。

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于特定视频领域或时长，需开发通用且鲁棒的视频时间定位模型。

Method: 结合时间戳标记与视频标记，自适应帧缩放处理不同长度视频，利用MLLMs进行时间定位。

Result: 在五个公开基准测试中，UniTime在零样本和微调设置下均优于现有方法，并显著提升长视频问答准确性。

Conclusion: UniTime展示了通用视频时间定位的潜力，为复杂视频理解任务提供价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过4D预训练学习通用的时空表示，以从少量视角和时间点重建物体。

Method: 4D-LRM通过统一的时空表示，直接从时间序列的姿势图像标记预测每像素的4D高斯基元，实现高效高质量的渲染。

Result: 模型在单次前向传播中重建24帧序列，耗时少于1.5秒，支持新物体泛化、时间插值和多样相机设置。

Conclusion: 4D-LRM证明了时空预训练的扩展性，能够实现高效且准确的4D重建。

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电影生成系统缺乏多样化的相机语言和电影节奏，导致视觉效果模板化和叙事乏味。FilMaster旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FilMaster分为两个阶段：参考引导生成阶段和生成后制作阶段，分别利用多镜头协同RAG相机语言设计和观众中心电影节奏控制模块。

Result: FilMaster在相机语言设计和电影节奏控制上表现优异，并通过FilmEval基准验证了其性能。

Conclusion: FilMaster通过整合专业电影原则和生成AI模型，推动了专业电影制作中生成AI的应用。

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

Method: 采用协作多智能体框架，自主识别、纠正和优化多面板故事可视化中的不一致性，支持迭代细粒度更新。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法在多面板一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关，可灵活集成多种扩散模型，有效提升故事可视化的视觉一致性。

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

Motivation: 旨在解决现有技术在生成逼真视频和交互性方面的不足，特别是时间一致性和低延迟反馈的挑战。

Method: 采用迭代分块预测技术，结合标记的游戏数据和无标记的真实世界视频进行训练，无需真实世界动作标注。

Result: 实现了控制信号从虚拟到真实场景的映射，并能够泛化控制多种实体（如自行车和行人）。

Conclusion: RealPlay展示了在逼真视频生成和交互性方面的潜力，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

Motivation: 解决现有方法在长期场景合成中因错误累积或短上下文窗口导致的场景一致性问题。

Method: 引入Surfel-Indexed View Memory（VMem），基于3D表面元素（surfels）几何索引过去视图，高效检索相关视图生成新内容。

Result: 在长期场景合成任务中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了场景一致性和相机控制能力。

Conclusion: VMem机制有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了长期场景的一致性。

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.
