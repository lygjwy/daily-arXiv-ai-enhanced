Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

In the domain of wildland fire science, this\nchallenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets\nwith labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data\nAugmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of\ndeep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving\nsegmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)\nidentify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization\ntechnique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined\nfire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity\nwhile preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The\neffectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical\nanalysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a\nweighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning\nmethods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,\npreventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B.

The improvements are more\npronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also\nobserve a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating\nimproved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis\nof PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze\nand mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a\ndeeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning\nobjectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages\nvisually grounded reasoning.

To enhance the advantage of Adam and\nmitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with\nthree key innovations. \\emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by\nemploying a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \\geq 1$) in the denominator,\ndeparting from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)\npreconditioning.

One reason is that current\npose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware\nfeatures using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB\ninformation is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate\nthis, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named\nMask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and\nvisible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB\nimages for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D\ncorrespondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the\npose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the\nintegrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard\ncluttered background information.

A common approach for calibration is\nfitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms\npredicted probabilities. A key desirable property of the calibration map is\ninstance-wise monotonicity (i.e., preserving the ranking of probability\noutputs). However, most existing post-hoc calibration methods do not guarantee\nmonotonicity.

We propose InvestAlign,\na novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging\ntheoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather\nthan complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training\nLLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than\nusing real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we\ndevelop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which\ndemonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT\nmodels in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our\nproposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address\ncomplex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor\ndecision-making processes under herd behavior.

Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's\nbecause it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating\nit into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset.

Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently\nfactorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static\nand foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,\ncapturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the\nmodern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a\nfixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different\nfuture environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust\ninitial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of\nsurrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes\nILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)\nattention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised\nlearning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts\nthe subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline\nfacilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively\nencoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze\nstep. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by\npredicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target\npatches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal\ndependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across\nscenes.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness.

To\naddress this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that\nleverages a range of $\\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent\nrepresentations.

To this end, inspired\nby the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we\npropose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,\nleveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.\nSpecifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to\ndistill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize\nthe predicted transformation.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure.

Preprint version", "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by\nleveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows.

Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query.

To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05.

A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via\ncaching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such\nfixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while\nmanually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To\naddress this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that\nautomatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated\ndirectly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,\nPCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional\ncaching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a\nkey limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to\nan oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance\nthe contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's\npredictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,\na transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral\ndependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact\nstructures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through\nsampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,\nSpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the\nchallenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is\nthe first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D\ngenerative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffSpectra\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad2D\u548c3D\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u662f\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5e93\u548c\u5ffd\u75653D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "DiffSpectra\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\u7684Denoising\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7f16\u7801\u5668SpecFormer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiffSpectra\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0ctop-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a16.01%\uff0ctop-20\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a96.86%\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffSpectra\u9996\u6b21\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5149\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u548c2D/3D\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing federated causal\nstructure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings.\nHowever, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain\ndata on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables\ncan easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the\ninformation transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we\ncomprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both\nhorizontal and vertical federated settings.

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images\nfrom an aerial perspective.

We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object\ncategories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the\nHIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating\nthese datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across\nboth new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new\napplications.

However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color\nspace-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due\nto the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)\ncolor space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red\nand black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color\nspace for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV\ncolor map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism.

This\napproach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple\noptimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it\nfails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits\nfundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL\nlosses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view\nmultiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations\nthrough two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to\nincorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data\npoint, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views\nwhile scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity.

This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of\nChinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute\nChinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765\ncategories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese\ncalligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on\nthe attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),\ndynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich\nmulti-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,\nincluding calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and\nevolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance\nthrough single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all\nof its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the\nstroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between\ntheir different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty\nof accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of\ndetailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for\nadvancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in\nmultiple fields.

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In\nthis paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for\nautonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data\nwith control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on\ntwo key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the\ninherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose\nthe Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama\ngeneration as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps\nbetween different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling\ncontrollable panoramic image generation.

In this work, we revisit small\nbatch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for\nscaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes.

Yet, their effectiveness\nin practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional\nchanges, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.\nTherefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the\nuse of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample\npredictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA\nmethods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or\nmake unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and\ntest data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and\nuniversally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the\nflexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model\nthe test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among\ntest samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous\naccess--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages\nby introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from\nVLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each\nonline test sample and update parameters.

Therefore, we conduct the first study of\nLiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present\na novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under\nadverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception\ncapabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due\nto the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed.

We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating\nrain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models.

The best established method for its estimation, from a\ntriangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),\nand computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is\nthe number of points.

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric\ndatasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for\nclassification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569\nfor captioning.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly\ninfers scale \"in the wild\" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified\nkeypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with\ngeometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective\ntransformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds\nor rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter\nmarks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling\nstrong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while\nmitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline\nthat combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add\nphotorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving\nperformance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a\nlightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression\nparameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling\nreal-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that\nRulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under\nchallenging real-world conditions.

Our system can transform images from extremely low\nresolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at\n256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three\ncore components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline\nbased on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages\nvision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze\nthe input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration\nAgent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection\nparadigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the\noptimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face\nrestoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and\nselfie photos.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
