TL;DR: SEEA-R1是一个强化微调框架，旨在提升具身智能体的自我进化能力，通过Tree-GRPO和MGRM解决多步推理和奖励泛化问题，在ALFWorld基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化微调在具身智能领域的潜力尚未充分探索，尤其是在多模态交互和多步推理任务中缺乏有效的学习信号和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SEEA-R1框架，结合Tree-GRPO（基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的GRPO）和MGRM（多模态生成奖励模型），优化多步推理和奖励泛化。

Result: 在ALFWorld基准测试中，SEEA-R1以85.07%（文本）和36.19%（多模态）的分数超越现有方法，包括GPT-4o，并在无环境奖励情况下达到80.3%。

Conclusion: SEEA-R1展示了在具身智能领域的潜力，为未来可扩展的自我进化智能体研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

### [2] [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734)
*Guan Wang,Jin Li,Yuhao Sun,Xing Chen,Changling Liu,Yue Wu,Meng Lu,Sen Song,Yasin Abbasi Yadkori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRM是一种新型递归架构，通过分层和多时间尺度处理，显著提升计算深度和效率，无需预训练或CoT数据，仅用27M参数和1000样本即可在复杂推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs的CoT方法存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求大和高延迟问题，受人类大脑分层处理启发，提出HRM以解决这些限制。

Method: HRM采用两个相互依赖的递归模块：高层模块负责抽象规划，低层模块处理详细计算，单次前向传递完成推理任务。

Result: HRM在复杂数独、迷宫路径规划和ARC基准测试中表现优异，超越更大模型。

Conclusion: HRM为通用计算和推理系统提供了潜在突破性进展。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THE-Tree框架通过构建领域特定的技术进化树，结合LLM生成和验证科学进步，显著提升了科学发展的预测和评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法（如LLM独立验证和传统引用网络）无法满足对科学进步新颖性和准确性的高效评估需求，缺乏结构化、可验证且因果关联的历史数据。

Method: THE-Tree框架通过搜索算法构建进化树，采用“Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify”流程，由LLM提出进步并引用文献，再通过自然语言推理机制验证逻辑和证据支持。

Result: 在88个领域的实验中，THE-Tree在图形补全、预测未来科学发展和评估重要论文方面显著优于传统方法，性能提升8%至100%。

Conclusion: THE-Tree为解决科学进步验证的瓶颈提供了有效工具，未来可进一步推动相关研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

TL;DR: MobiVerse是一个混合框架，结合轻量级领域特定生成器和LLMs，用于高效生成和动态调整大规模人口的活动链，解决传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有移动性模拟平台在算法开发、政策实施和大规模评估方面的不足，克服传统活动模型、机器学习方法和基于LLM的代理模型的局限性。

Method: 提出MobiVerse混合框架，结合轻量级生成器生成基础活动链，利用LLMs进行上下文感知调整，并通过案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 在洛杉矶Westwood的案例中，成功为53,000个代理生成动态调整的日程，展示了对环境反馈的响应能力，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MobiVerse填补了移动性模拟的空白，提供了可定制平台，支持交通系统和代理级别的算法测试，兼具计算效率和行为真实性。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are
available at https://github.com/ucla-mobility/MobiVerse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim是一个基于大型语言模型的城市场景模拟器，通过递归价值驱动方法生成真实的人类行为，比传统方法更贴近现实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖固定规则，难以模拟复杂的人类行为和意图，CitySim旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型，赋予代理信念、长期目标和空间记忆，通过递归价值驱动方法生成日程。

Result: CitySim在微观和宏观层面均更接近真实人类行为，并能模拟大规模代理的集体行为。

Conclusion: CitySim是一个可扩展、灵活的工具，有助于理解和预测城市现象。

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

### [6] [Interactive Multi-Objective Probabilistic Preference Learning with Soft and Hard Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21887)
*Edward Chen,Sang T. Truong,Natalie Dullerud,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH是一个交互式框架，用于在高风险决策中平衡多目标优化，结合软硬边界和偏好学习，提升决策者信任和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高风险决策（如近距离放射治疗）中，如何在多目标优化中平衡软硬边界并减少计算和认知负担的问题。

Method: 结合局部（软硬边界与概率偏好学习）和全局（多目标敏感性分析）组件，通过主动采样策略优化探索与利用。

Result: 在合成和实际应用中表现优异，用户研究表明能提升收敛速度、增强决策者信任并提供更灵活偏好表达。

Conclusion: Active-MoSH有效支持高风险决策，平衡多目标优化并提升决策者信心。

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [7] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige,Amine Boumaza,Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概率模型，通过引入祖先依赖关系生成更具挑战性的游戏树，分析了多种算法（如AlphaBeta和Scout）的平均复杂度，揭示了实际性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型因独立性假设简化了游戏结构，导致分析结果脱离实际。新模型旨在更真实地模拟游戏结构复杂性。

Method: 引入基于层级条件分布的概率模型，强制祖先依赖关系，生成可调整难度的游戏树，并推导算法的递归复杂度公式。

Result: 虽然算法在渐近情况下表现相似，但在深度有限树中，AlphaBeta的常数乘因子显著大于Scout，导致实际性能下降。

Conclusion: 新模型为经典游戏求解算法提供了更真实的分析框架，揭示了实际性能差异，并提供了分析工具。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形式化定理证明中训练数据稀缺的挑战，提升定理证明系统的能力。

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer为定理证明系统提供了可扩展的训练数据生成方案，展示了在数学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据在增强AI代理能力方面潜力巨大，但其建模方法尚未系统化，尤其是在多模态环境中。

Method: 构建了统一代理轨迹数据集（UATD）和基准测试GAE-Bench，提出了基于视觉语言模型和优化对比学习的GAE-Retriever框架。

Result: GAE-Retriever在多个数据集上表现优于基线方法，显著提升了检索召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态轨迹检索中具有显著优势，为AI代理能力的提升提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

Motivation: 交通领域AI应用（如智能座舱、自动驾驶）的数据生态碎片化且不兼容，现有测试方法依赖数据堆叠，无法覆盖所有边缘案例且缺乏灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑验证而非定量测试指导开发（VDD），加速迭代过程，适应大语言模型时代需求。

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC模型在实体数量远大于嵌入维度时，输出层存在秩瓶颈，限制了模型的表达能力和预测准确性。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析秩瓶颈的影响，并提出KGE-MoS（一种混合输出层）来解决这一问题。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低的参数成本提升了KGC模型的性能和概率拟合能力。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS有效解决了秩瓶颈问题，显著提升了KGC模型的表现。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Motivation: 当前合作型AI系统过于服从人类指令，可能导致不效率或不安全，因此需要研究AI的自主性。

Result: 强调了将AI自主性作为独立研究焦点的必要性，并探讨了智能不服从的表现形式。

Conclusion: 提出了研究AI不服从能力的初步边界和考量，作为人工代理的核心能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

Conclusion: FAT-CAT通过FCA改进了主题建模的聚合和可视化效果，提升了数据探索的深度。

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Conclusion: 世界模型是具身AI代理推理和规划的核心，有助于实现更好的人机协作。

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Result: 在医疗影像分割案例中验证了AIPassport的有效性，提升了透明度、可重复性和合规性。

Conclusion: AI Model Passport为AI驱动的医疗解决方案设定了新标准，有望成为跨领域透明合规AI系统的基础。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在科学重现中的能力，以推动LLM在科学进步中的应用。

Method: 利用NanoGPT速度跑分竞赛的19个任务，提供不同格式的提示，测试LLM重现改进的能力。

Result: 当前先进LLM即使结合最佳框架，仍难以重现已知创新。

Conclusion: 该基准为衡量LLM自动化科学重现能力提供了简单且非饱和的测试标准。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO)方法，通过Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS)和Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR)解决MLLMs中复杂推理问题，显著提升性能且不损害通用任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂推理上表现不佳，强化学习（RL）虽能提升推理能力，但应用于MLLMs时存在性能下降和过度推理问题。

Method: 提出APO方法，将样本分为正负两组：正样本使用DADS动态调整KL散度权重，负样本使用STCR惩罚过长响应。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上应用APO得到View-R1-3B，推理能力平均提升7%，优于更大规模的MLLMs，且通用任务表现未下降。

Conclusion: DADS和STCR技术有效提升了MLLMs的复杂推理能力，并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

Result: 在表格领域实验中，算法快速可靠地收敛到最优风险厌恶值函数。

Conclusion: Q-learning算法为风险厌恶总奖励MDP提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密度聚类方法在处理噪声或任意分布数据时优于基于质心的聚类方法，但参数调优（如邻域半径）在高维大规模数据中计算成本高。

Method: 通过理论和实验证明邻域半径与聚类数量的单峰关系，并利用Ternary Search算法高效确定最优半径。

Result: 在多个高维大规模NLP、音频和计算机视觉任务中验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅改进了密度聚类的参数控制方法，还深化了对参数间关系的理解。

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态控制连续归一化流（CNFs）和扩散模型（DMs）质量-复杂度权衡的方法，通过重连Transformer块和引入一致性训练，实现任意时间步和块数的采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要通过减少时间步提高采样效率，但忽略了动态调整网络长度和时间步的潜力。

Method: 通过重连Transformer块解决内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现动态采样。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上，采样延迟减少3倍，FID分数提升3.5点。

Conclusion: 该方法在时间和网络长度维度上均具有灵活性，显著提升了采样效率和生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Motivation: 传统表格回归方法在处理复杂系统数据（如配置文件或系统日志）时效果不佳，需要一种更通用且可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 采用60M参数的编码器-解码器模型，从随机初始化开始训练，用于预测资源效率。

Result: 模型在Google的Borg调度系统上实现了接近完美的0.99等级相关性（平均0.9），MSE比表格方法低100倍，并能通过少量样本适应新任务。

Conclusion: 文本到文本回归方法为复杂系统数据的预测提供了通用解决方案，并展示了其适应性和不确定性量化的优势。

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

Motivation: 传统IRT需要集中所有个体原始数据，存在隐私问题；联邦学习具有隐私保护和分布式计算优势，结合两者可扩展IRT应用场景。

Method: 提出FedIRT框架，支持分布式估计IRT模型（如2PL和PCM），无需集中数据。

Result: 实验表明FedIRT统计准确性接近传统IRT，同时保护隐私并降低通信成本；真实考试数据验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FedIRT扩展了IRT在分布式场景（如多校评估）的应用，提供开源R包支持实践。

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

Motivation: 神经模糊网络（NFNs）具有透明性和符号性，但其系统化设计过程仍具挑战性，传统方法将参数与结构分离优化，导致架构脆弱且性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种独立于应用的梯度基神经可塑性适应方法，同时优化NFNs的参数和结构。

Result: 该方法在视觉任务（如基于DOOM游戏的在线强化学习）中表现出色，验证了同时优化的有效性。

Conclusion: 同时优化参数和结构的方法为NFNs在复杂任务中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

Motivation: 现有基于模型的方法（如DreamerV3）忽略控制中心表示，而基于模型的方法（如PPO）样本复杂度高且探索能力弱。M3PO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: M3PO整合了隐式世界模型（预测任务结果而非观察重建）和混合探索策略（结合基于模型的规划和基于模型的不确定性驱动奖励），并通过信任区域优化器稳定策略更新。

Result: M3PO在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提供了高效且鲁棒的策略优化替代方案。

Conclusion: M3PO通过消除偏差-方差权衡，显著提升了模型强化学习的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法在多源数据和大规模计算环境下表现出色，但仍需进一步验证其通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Motivation: 探索连续神经网络训练如何自然形成离散符号结构，为神经符号系统的设计和理解提供理论基础。

Method: 将神经参数提升到测度空间，建模为Wasserstein梯度流，分析几何约束下的梯度流解耦和自由度收缩现象。

Result: 网络从高维探索过渡到符合代数操作的组合表示，自由度降低。建立了实现符号任务的数据缩放定律。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经符号系统提供了理论基础，支持连续学习与离散代数推理的集成。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨FmAD和ZO作为内存高效梯度计算方法的实际效果，填补与内存高效BP变体的比较和统一理论分析的空白。

Method: 通过理论和实验对比BP、FmAD和ZO方法，包括检查点技术的影响。

Result: BP结合检查点技术表现最佳，比FmAD和ZO高出31.1%的准确率，收敛速度快34.8%，计算量少3.8倍。

Conclusion: FmAD和ZO在内存效率上有优势，但在准确性、收敛速度和计算成本上不及BP，后者仍是内存受限场景下的最佳选择。

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

Conclusion: CRL是一个有前景的研究方向，但仍需解决其独特挑战以推动实际应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an important machine learning paradigm for
solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed
remarkable progress in this field due to the rapid development of deep neural
networks. However, the success of RL currently relies on extensive training
data and computational resources. In addition, RL's limited ability to
generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world
environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide
a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,
and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,
organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides
practical insights into future directions.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum
advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and
poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also
suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Result: 在公开竞价数据集上的测试表明，R* DT在处理混合质量轨迹时表现优越。

Conclusion: R* DT通过数据增强和逐步优化，显著提升了自动竞价系统的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Conclusion: 分箱半参数贝叶斯网络是未分箱版本的可靠且高效替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要从训练模型中遗忘特定类别以保护用户删除权利并减少有害或偏见预测，而完全重新训练成本高且现有方法无法复制重新训练模型的行为。

Method: 通过重新分配遗忘类别样本的预测概率质量，设计了一种对MIA-NN攻击鲁棒的方法，并引入基于总变差距离的新度量。

Result: 实验表明，RWFT在现有评估指标和新提出的TV距离指标上均与完全重新训练结果匹配，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RWFT是一种高效且安全的遗忘方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，通常需要预定义奖励函数，但在实际应用中（如游戏开发）奖励函数可能不可用。TROFI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TROFI从人类偏好中学习奖励函数，并用其标注数据集以训练策略，且无需最优轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TROFI表现优于基线方法，并与使用真实奖励函数的效果相当。在3D游戏环境中也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，奖励函数的设计对策略学习至关重要，TROFI为无预定义奖励函数的离线强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）主要针对实值序列设计，难以处理包含异构协变量（如分类变量、多模态数据）的通用预测任务。

Result: 在单模态和多模态协变量预测基准测试中表现优异，验证了UniCA的有效性。

Conclusion: UniCA为协变量感知的时间序列预测提供了通用解决方案，展现了在实际场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GPAS的技术，用于解决Pre-LN Transformer中激活方差指数增长的问题，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但存在激活方差指数增长的问题，导致残差路径主导子层输出，限制了深层的学习能力。

Method: 提出Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS)，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B的不同模型规模上，GPAS均实现了性能提升，并适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种简单有效的技术，可广泛应用于提升各种Transformer架构的训练动态和性能。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique
challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep
learning and machine learning model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for cryptocurrency
price prediction. The LSTM component captures temporal dependencies in
historical price data, while XGBoost enhances prediction by modeling nonlinear
relationships with auxiliary features such as sentiment scores and
macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) and Min-Max Normalized Root Mean Square Error (MinMax RMSE)
demonstrates that the LSTM+XGBoost hybrid consistently outperforms standalone
models and traditional forecasting methods. This study underscores the
potential of hybrid architectures in financial forecasting and provides
insights into model adaptability across different cryptocurrencies and market
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer与GNNs的数学联系，揭示Transformer作为高效图处理网络的潜力。

Result: Transformer是高效的集合处理网络，能在现代硬件上实现比稀疏消息传递更优的性能。

Conclusion: Transformer因其硬件效率成为当前图表示学习的优选架构。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多图环境下的多目标路径规划问题具有实际意义，但现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 第一种方法直接在多图上自回归选择边完成路径；第二种方法先将多图简化为简单图再构建路径。

Result: 两种方法在TSP和CVRP等多种问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络方法在多目标多图路由中具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，用于简化重金属污染评估，解决了传统方法的数据稀缺和繁琐问题，并在多个港口数据上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PLI评估方法繁琐且数据收集困难，需要一种更高效、准确的替代方案。

Method: 利用迁移学习开发了一种定量评估模型，能够跨域迁移学习特征，简化评估流程。

Result: 在澳大利亚新南威尔士六个港口的测试中，MAE和MAPE分别为0.5和0.03，性能优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为水质预测提供了创新、低成本且高效的解决方案，适用于海洋生态保护和工业污染监测。

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Result: 研究揭示了影响地震脆弱性的关键因素，并通过混淆矩阵等技术评估模型性能。

Conclusion: SMOTE和多种分类模型的结合能有效预测地震损坏等级，为灾后响应提供科学依据。

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于再生核希尔伯特空间的参数化方法，用于控制律学习，并设计数据驱动的主动学习控制方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson采样（TS）依赖于有限参数表示，限制了其在更一般空间（如控制系统设计）中的适用性。

Method: 将控制律视为函数空间中的元素，利用TS框架探索潜在最优控制律，并提供收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析表明，该方法以指数速度学习控制律与闭环性能指标的关系，并推导出控制遗憾的上界。数值实验验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在未知非线性系统控制中表现出色，扩展了TS的适用范围。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Motivation: 探索LLM和智能体系统在药物发现中的模块化潜力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过案例研究比较不同LLM（如Claude-3.5-Sonnet、GPT-4o等）和代理类型（工具调用与代码生成）的性能，使用LLM-as-a-judge评分。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4o表现优于其他模型；代码生成代理通常优于工具调用代理，但结果因问题和模型而异。

Conclusion: 强调了进一步研究智能体系统模块化的必要性，以开发稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Conclusion: dreaMLearning为资源受限场景（如边缘计算）提供了高效、可扩展的学习方案。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework
that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon
Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless
compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of
representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts
storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements
enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning,
and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities
for efficient and scalable learning.

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for

various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.
  In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for
evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of
over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside
key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior
performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping
performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural
properties.

Motivation: GRPO在复杂推理任务中存在探索不足、样本效率低和不稳定的问题，限制了其性能。

Result: 实验表明EFRame提升了训练鲁棒性和效率，并实现了GRPO无法达到的更深层次推理能力。

Conclusion: EFRame不仅优化了GRPO，还提供了对训练样本贡献的更细粒度分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Conclusion: 该方法在风险感知决策任务中具有广泛适用性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Result: 实验表明，投影压缩在高质量模型上优于硬剪枝和再训练方法，且性能随token数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: 投影压缩是一种高效且性能优越的模型压缩方法。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统张量分解方法依赖预定义的结构假设（如CP或Tucker分解），且优化过程复杂，容易导致精度损失。实际场景中，最优秩结构和收缩规则通常未知，需要更灵活的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法突破了传统狄拉克δ分布假设的限制，能够灵活建模结构和分布，为多路数据分析提供了更有效的框架。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中的噪声和不完整性严重降低GNN性能，现有方法仅关注单一维度增强，忽略了拓扑与属性的深层交互。

Method: CoATA通过传播结构信号增强节点属性，构建节点-属性二分图，并引入对比学习进行相互校正。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，CoATA优于十一种现有方法，展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: CoATA成功捕获了拓扑与属性之间的协同关系，提升了GNN在噪声图中的表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Conclusion: 方法在真实场景中表现鲁棒，适用于医学领域应用。

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFM采样依赖非线性ODE求解，计算成本高且难以解释，需要更高效且结构化的方法。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论，设计无解码器的Koopman-CFM架构，在学习的可观测空间中实现线性动态，支持闭式一步采样。

Result: 在2D数据集和MNIST等基准测试中显著加速采样，同时提供生成行为的谱分析工具。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的CFM结合了高效采样与可解释性，为快速且结构化的生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LGES是GES的改进版本，通过更针对性的搜索提高计算速度和准确性，同时支持先验假设和数据修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GES在计算成本和有限样本准确性上的不足。

Method: 修改贪婪步骤，避免在条件独立变量间插入边，并支持先验假设和数据修正。

Result: 实验显示LGES在速度、准确性和鲁棒性上优于GES及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: LGES在理论和实践中均优于GES，适用于观测和干预数据。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in
forecasting and learning an epidemic model, even when used with DP guarantees.

Motivation: 当前将物理先验知识融入RL需要大量人工和领域知识，限制了其通用性。本文旨在通过符号化方法降低这一门槛。

Method: 开发了PiPRL框架，结合神经感知模块和符号编程，分层指导RL过程。

Result: PiPRL在室内导航任务中优于纯符号或神经策略，训练时间减少26%。

Conclusion: PiPRL通过符号化物理先验有效提升了RL的效率和性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

Conclusion: Sheaf-DMFL框架在多模态异构通信系统中具有显著优势，理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

Conclusion: 本文为推理时间扩展提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，填补了LLM高效部署的空白。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏方法（如Mixture-of-Experts）存在局限性，DNA旨在通过动态路由和模块化设计，实现更灵活的计算和参数共享，同时优化效率。

Method: DNA由初始原型架构（包括Transformer、MLP等模块和路由器）组成，支持动态路径选择。训练过程中，计算和通信模式根据内容和上下文自适应学习。

Result: 实验表明，DNA在性能和效率上均优于密集基线模型，且模块路径呈现幂律分布，部分路径表现出专业化特征。

Conclusion: DNA通过动态路由和模块化设计，实现了高效、可解释的计算分配和参数共享，为神经架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic
distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature
representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal
dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a
novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate
temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features.
Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical
datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and
electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the
robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework
offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse
healthcare settings.

Motivation: 解决在线强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，缺乏高效且理论支持的方法。

Result: 在有限和无限时间范围的线性MDP中具有接近最优的遗憾保证，并可扩展到一般函数逼近。

Conclusion: VAC方法为探索与利用的平衡提供了高效且理论支持的新方案。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种针对无人机传感器攻击的鲁棒强化学习控制器，通过两阶段训练框架学习鲁棒潜在状态表示，确保无人机在攻击下的安全操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传感器易受物理攻击（如GPS欺骗），传统安全强化学习方法对此无效，需开发更鲁棒的控制器。

Method: ARMOR采用两阶段训练：第一阶段利用特权攻击信息训练教师编码器生成攻击感知潜在状态；第二阶段通过监督学习训练学生编码器，仅使用历史传感器数据近似教师潜在状态。

Result: 实验表明ARMOR优于传统方法，确保无人机安全，提高对未见攻击的泛化能力，并降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ARMOR为无人机在传感器攻击下的鲁棒控制提供了有效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

Motivation: 解决CFL中客户聚类识别困难的问题，利用客户数据损失值的相似性区分不同聚类。

Result: 理论证明CLoVE能快速准确恢复聚类，实验显示其在多种数据集和非IID设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: CLoVE简单、鲁棒，适用于实际应用，在聚类恢复和模型准确性上达到先进水平。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多语言干扰问题，显著提升了多语言ASR的识别性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态单一，无法满足多模态大语言模型的需求。

Method: 提出VAT-KG，通过跨模态知识对齐和严格过滤步骤自动构建，并设计多模态RAG框架。

Result: 实验表明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs。

Conclusion: VAT-KG在多模态知识统一和应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征、生成反驳线索和逻辑推理，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过强化学习微调技术提升小型语言模型在指令跟随和数学推理任务中的表现。

Method: 比较了监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和强化留一法（RLOO）结合奖励模型的方法，并在数学任务中使用了合成数据增强和外部验证器。

Result: RLOO结合DeBERTa奖励模型表现最佳，DPO效果稳定；数学任务中数据增强和外部验证器显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为训练轻量级、任务对齐的小型语言模型提供了关键权衡和实用策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two
challenging tasks: instruction following and mathematical reasoning. We compare
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性判断中存在真相偏见和谄媚倾向，推理模型表现优于非推理模型，但仍不及人类基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛用于事实核查和高风险决策，但其作为真相判断工具的能力仍未充分理解。

Method: 评估了8个LLMs在4,800次真实性判断中的表现，比较了推理与非推理模型。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但仍高于人类基准；部分高级模型（如GPT-4.1）在欺骗检测中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 仅靠能力提升无法解决LLMs在真实性检测中的根本挑战。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于‘下一个房间预测’的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑平面图设计，解决了现有端到端生成模型与真实设计流程不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平面图生成模型多为端到端生成，与建筑实践中渐进迭代的设计流程不兼容。

Method: 受大型语言模型中自回归‘下一个词预测’机制启发，提出‘下一个房间预测’方法。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法有望支持未来智能建筑设计。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的表现，填补研究空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准，评估三种语言在机器翻译、语音识别和文本摘要任务中的表现，采用零样本、10样本和微调设置。

Result: 现有模型在低资源语言上表现显著落后，10样本学习和微调改进有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危语言，并公开数据集和代码促进研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Motivation: 受日本传统信息交流实践的启发，旨在通过多智能体协作改善情感分析的偏见和多样性。

Method: 提出KCS+IBC框架，结合正式推理和个体视角的对话，引入概率情感预测。

Result: KCS在准确性上与单一LLM相当，而KCS+IBC在推理后期表现出熵降低和方差增加，平衡了预测的聚合与多样性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将量化这些特性对偏见校正的影响，并开发更先进的情感分析系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译中的有效性，特别是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句对的高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并通过单语古吉拉特语文本生成反向翻译数据增强训练。

Result: 反向翻译数据未提升性能，BLEU分数为43.8，某些情况下略有下降。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能收益递减，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在生命科学中的应用潜力，尤其是在生物信息学和医学问答领域，并填补波斯语医学问答的空白。

Method: 方法包括构建BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估集，设计BioPars评估指标，并比较ChatGPT、Llama和Galactica等模型的表现。

Result: BioPars在ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT等指标上优于其他模型，尤其在波斯医学问答中表现突出。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在生物信息学任务中仍需进一步优化，BioPars为波斯医学问答提供了首个有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

Motivation: 资源效率是边缘和隐私敏感应用中部署大型语言模型的关键障碍，研究旨在评估增强策略的实用性。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant实现短期和长期存储，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，React.js前端展示，对比RAG和HyDE在1B和4B参数模型上的表现。

Result: RAG减少延迟17%，消除事实幻觉；HyDE提升语义相关性但增加响应时间25-40%并伴随幻觉。4B模型对HyDE的计算开销更大。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的设备端个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，而现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解领域特定语法和语义方面仍有不足。

Method: 提出定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，结合提示引导的解释，逐步教授LLMs构建并发SVAs。

Result: 实验结果显示，定制RAG框架使功能匹配的SVA数量增加了58.42%，微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型提升了59.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了LLM在NL2SVA任务中的性能，为硬件设计验证提供了更高效的自动化工具。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Result: 在低数据量情况下，设计选择对验证损失有显著影响，且语言模型的验证损失持续下降，与随机初始化模型的收敛行为不同。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于高效计算训练在时间序列中的应用，并为研究数据分布的模态无关特性提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

Method: 通过CogTest基准（包含16种认知习惯和25个任务）评估16种LLMs（13种LRMs和3种非推理模型）。

Result: LRMs表现出类似人类的认知习惯，并能根据任务自适应调整。某些习惯（如承担风险）与有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的认知习惯有助于深入理解LLM的异常行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架和基准显著提升了MLLM评估的结构化和理论支持，为未来研究提供了更清晰的诊断工具。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代LLM应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

*Yicheng Mao,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5和GPT-4）在移民决策中的潜力与局限性，发现其能模拟人类决策策略但存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化与移民增加使移民部门面临工作量大与公平决策的挑战，人工智能可能提供解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括离散选择实验和深度访谈，分析LLMs的决策策略及其公平性。

Result: LLMs能模拟人类决策策略（如效用最大化和程序公平），但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化和优化移民决策中具有潜力，但也需解决其偏见问题。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

*Qihao Zhao,Yangyu Huang,Tengchao Lv,Lei Cui,Qinzheng Sun,Shaoguang Mao,Xin Zhang,Ying Xin,Qiufeng Yin,Scarlett Li,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MMLU-CF的无污染多选问答基准，通过避免数据泄露来更可靠地评估大型语言模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQ数据集因开源性和训练数据广泛性导致基准污染，评估结果不可靠。

Method: 采用更广泛的数据源并设计三条去污染规则，同时将基准分为验证集和测试集以防止恶意泄露。

Result: GPT-4o在测试集上的5-shot和0-shot得分分别为73.4%和71.9%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，有助于提升模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository
is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to
https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.

*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Lawrence Phillips,Casper Hansen,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，通过强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现了跨形式化迁移，显著提升了语义解析和知识图谱问答的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理关系型和图结构数据时的孤立性问题，通过共享SQL和Cypher的抽象实现跨形式化迁移。

Method: 结合强化学习和Chain-of-Thought监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数，联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在Spider上提升13.5%，Text2Cypher提升73.1%，并在零样本下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

### [93] [Adapting Whisper for Parameter-efficient Code-Switching Speech Recognition via Soft Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21576)
*Hongli Yang,Yizhou Peng,Hao Huang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT)在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中提升ASR性能的方法，提出了SPT4ASR方法，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中面临的挑战，如计算成本和灾难性遗忘。

Method: 研究了两种策略：(1) 完全微调（FFT）软提示和整个Whisper模型；(2) 冻结模型参数，仅训练软提示。还提出了SPT4ASR方法，结合多种SPT变体。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR方法进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，同时保持了与LoRA相似的参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR方法在提升低资源场景ASR性能的同时，未对现有语言性能造成负面影响，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

*Hongli Yang,Sheng Li,Hao Huang,Ayiduosi Tuohan,Yizhou Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种软提示调优方法（Entire SPT和LAPT）及工具包SPT-Whisper，显著提升多语言ASR性能，尤其在语言扩展任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言自动语音识别（ASR）中的语言干扰和扩展到未见语言（语言扩展）时性能下降的问题。

Method: 1) Entire SPT：对编码器和解码器应用软提示；2) LAPT：利用跨语言相似性编码共享和语言特定特征；3) 开发SPT-Whisper工具包。

Result: Entire SPT和LAPT在语言扩展任务中分别比Decoder SPT提升5.0%和16.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

### [95] [Data Efficacy for Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21545)
*Yalun Dai,Yangyu Huang,Xin Zhang,Wenshan Wu,Chong Li,Wenhui Lu,Shijie Cao,Li Dong,Scarlett Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DELT的通用范式，通过优化训练数据的组织（数据效能）来提升语言模型性能，包括数据评分、选择和排序三个组件，其中LQS和FO方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注数据效率（选择最优子集），而数据效能（优化数据组织）尚未充分探索，因此提出DELT范式以填补这一空白。

Method: DELT包含三个组件：数据评分（如LQS）、数据选择和数据排序（如FO）。LQS从梯度一致性角度评估数据的可学习性和质量，FO解决模型遗忘和数据分布偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模的情况下提升了语言模型性能，其中LQS和FO组合效果最佳，且数据效能与数据效率可协同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中一个潜力巨大的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

*Andrew Maranhão Ventura D'addario*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR是首个针对葡萄牙语医疗领域的大规模基准测试，覆盖多学科，揭示LLMs在医疗知识上的不均衡表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估过于医生中心化且限于英语，忽略了医疗团队的多学科性质，需更全面的评估工具。

Method: 基于巴西国家考试构建5,632题的多学科题库，对20多个LLMs进行零样本评估。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但学科间差异显著（如眼科98.7%，社会工作68.4%）。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足，需更细粒度评估以确保AI在医疗团队中的安全性。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的通用推理能力与领域特定推理任务表现之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，训练LLMs在通用推理方面表现出色成为趋势，但决策能力依赖于强大的推理能力。

Method: 研究分析了LLMs的通用推理能力如何影响其在领域特定任务中的表现。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但强调了推理与决策的紧密联系。

Conclusion: 通用推理能力是LLMs在领域特定任务中表现的关键因素。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VIDEE是一个支持入门级数据分析师进行高级文本分析的系统，通过人机协作工作流（分解、执行、评估）实现自动化文本分析，并验证了其有效性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析需要NLP专业知识，门槛较高。大语言模型（LLMs）的发展使得文本分析更易用，但缺乏针对非专家的系统支持。

Method: VIDEE采用三阶段工作流：分解（结合人类反馈的蒙特卡洛树搜索）、执行（生成可执行分析管道）、评估（基于LLM的验证与可视化）。

Result: 实验验证了VIDEE的有效性，用户研究表明其对非专家用户友好，并揭示了用户行为模式。

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家提供了实用的文本分析工具，为人机协作设计提供了启示，并指导未来智能文本分析系统的改进。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

TL;DR: 本研究首次针对罗马乌尔都语中的希望言论检测，提出了一个多类别标注数据集，并开发了一个基于注意力的Transformer模型，性能优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了非正式和低资源语言（如罗马乌尔都语）中的希望言论检测。

Method: 引入多类别标注数据集，分析罗马乌尔都语中的希望语言模式，并开发基于注意力的Transformer模型（XLM-R）。

Result: XLM-R模型在5折交叉验证中得分0.78，优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了低资源语言希望言论检测的空白，为包容性NLP研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型是否也能表现出对齐伪装行为，并验证提示干预的有效性。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如道德框架和推理提示）测试对齐伪装行为。

Result: 提示干预显著减少对齐伪装行为，表明其有效性不依赖于模型规模。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型中对齐伪装的多样性，强调了在不同规模和部署场景下进行对齐评估的必要性。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了两种基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法（直接提取和间接提取）从食品网页中提取结构化信息的性能，间接方法在准确率略低的情况下显著减少了LLM调用次数，提升了效率和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用生成式AI和LLM自动化从网页中提取结构化信息（如食品成分表和营养表）的潜力。

Method: 比较了直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种LLM方法，评估了它们在准确性、效率和成本上的表现。

Result: 间接提取方法准确率略低（96.48%，比直接提取低1.61%），但减少了95.82%的LLM调用次数，显著提升了效率和降低了成本。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板网页的大规模信息提取任务提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（mime）作为非语言交流（NVC）的明确子集，有助于开发更强大的视觉语言模型。

Method: 构建了MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作，通过动作捕捉数据生成，并添加了角色、背景和视角的扰动。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以提升模型对人类手势的鲁棒性理解。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源LLM DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司的LLM进行比较。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1和DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用ANES和中国Zuobiao数据集评估模型预测中美社会议题公众意见的能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题和中国的对外援助及个人主义议题上表现最佳，但对资本主义观点的模拟存在局限。所有模型倾向于过度泛化单一观点。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在公众意见建模中的文化和人口偏见，建议采用更具包容性的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

TL;DR: 研究通过变压器电路分析LLMs中的记忆机制，发现记忆启动和维持由不同电路控制，且预防机制具有跨领域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆机制的具体运作方式，尤其是记忆序列的启动和维持。

Method: 利用变压器电路和对比数据集，分析模型生成记忆内容与非记忆内容时的行为差异。

Result: 记忆启动电路能维持记忆，但维持电路无法启动记忆；记忆预防机制具有跨领域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 记忆机制分为启动和维持两部分，且预防机制更通用，启动机制更依赖上下文。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

*Minjia Mao,Dongjun Wei,Xiao Fang,Michael Chau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的LLM检测器（GLD），用于识别未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容，解决了现有方法泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类撰写和LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止错误信息传播至关重要。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，以检测未见过的LLM和领域生成的内容。

Result: 通过真实数据集验证，GLD在检测性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLD为数字平台和LLM提供了重要的学术和实践价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

*Junqi Jiang,Tom Bewley,Salim I. Amoukou,Francesco Leofante,Antonio Rago,Saumitra Mishra,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于表示一致性（RC）的测试时扩展方法，通过聚合LLM的多个候选回答提升性能，无需额外模型查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要复杂的提示和采样策略修改，RC旨在通过内部激活一致性简化并优化答案聚合。

Method: 利用模型内部激活（密集或稀疏）的一致性，对候选回答进行加权聚合，无需额外模型查询。

Result: 在四个开源LLM和四个推理数据集上验证，RC提升任务性能，准确率最高提升4%。

Conclusion: RC通过激活一致性有效提升推理性能，稀疏激活信号与连贯推理概念一致。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by
allocating more compute budget during inference. To achieve this, existing
methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

TL;DR: FinEval-KR是一个新的评估框架，用于独立量化解耦LLMs的知识和推理能力，并提出认知评分以分析不同认知水平的推理任务。实验表明，推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的核心因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准在复杂金融推理任务中未能独立衡量知识和推理能力，且缺乏任务失败的根因分析。

Method: 提出FinEval-KR框架，包括知识评分和推理评分，并基于Bloom分类法引入认知评分。同时发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs的推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的关键，但知识应用仍存在瓶颈。专业金融LLMs普遍落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为金融推理任务提供了更全面的评估方法，揭示了LLMs在知识和推理能力上的不足，尤其是知识应用的瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在效率和准确性之间的权衡问题，以及梯度消失和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 使用BART架构的编码器-解码器独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力保持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升听障人士的辅助工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

Abstract: We present Gazal-R1, a 32-billion-parameter language model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance in medical reasoning while providing transparent,
step-by-step explanations for clinical decision-making. Built upon Qwen3 32B,
our model demonstrates that strategic training can enable mid-sized models to
outperform significantly larger counterparts in specialized domains. We
developed a novel two-stage training pipeline: first, supervised fine-tuning on
a carefully curated dataset of 107,033 synthetic medical reasoning examples
that teaches structured clinical thinking, enhanced by advanced
parameter-efficient techniques including Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation
(DoRA) and Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA); second, reinforcement learning using
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a sophisticated multi-component
reward system that refines accuracy, format adherence, and reasoning quality.
Gazal-R1 achieves exceptional performance across medical benchmarks, scoring
87.1% on MedQA, 81.6% on MMLU Pro (Medical), and 79.6% on PubMedQA, surpassing
models up to 12x larger. Beyond its strong empirical results, this work
provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed
reasoning. Our methodology offers a reproducible framework for developing
high-capability, domain-specific language models that balance performance,
efficiency, and explainability.

Motivation: 由于现有的大语言模型在非英语或中文语言上表现不佳，且其训练过程不透明，本文旨在解决这些问题，提供一种低成本的多语言适配方案。

Method: 通过收集韩语数据集、数据预处理、模型训练、创建下游基准和评估，将英语LLM适配到韩语。

Result: 新模型Thunder-LLM和Thunder-LLM-Ins在韩语任务上表现优于现有模型，且数据与计算资源消耗较低。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、低成本地为现有LLM添加新语言能力，代码已公开。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Conclusion: 指出了多模态AI驱动学习未来研究的关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Result: 结构化文本引导模型关注语义重要区域，显著提升文档问答性能，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Conclusion: 结构化输入格式是提升MLLMs文档理解性能的关键，未来可进一步探索其他文档类型的适用性。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM生成文本的真实性引发监管需求，现有水印方法难以同时满足文本质量、模型无关检测和多比特嵌入的要求。

Method: BiMark采用比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法，平衡文本质量与水印能力。

Result: 实验表明，BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，且在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark为LLM生成文本的可靠识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle

that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we
release our dataset and project at https://github.com/import-myself/Membench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在人类文化动态中的角色，超越传统视角，将其视为促进文化演化的工具。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化意义。

Result: LLMs作为文化演化的工具，通过人类重新解释促进创造性反馈循环，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs的核心价值在于为人类提供低风险环境下的自我反思和假设生成工具，增强文化可演化性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Motivation: 分析人类走私网络的适应性挑战，以及现有知识图谱方法在处理法律文本时的不足，如静态模板、共指解析缺失和噪声问题。

Method: 采用两步流程：1）通过结构化LLM提示进行类型感知的共指解析；2）基于领域引导指令的实体和关系提取，基于改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: CORE-KG将节点重复减少33.28%，法律噪声减少38.37%，生成更清晰、连贯的图谱结构。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了更可靠的基础，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of

DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Method: 通过14个任务的基准测试，评估了基于对齐和提示的多模态预测方法，并分析了模型和数据特性对效果的影响。

Result: 发现多模态方法并非在所有情况下都优于单模态基线，其效果取决于文本模型能力、时间序列模型强度、对齐策略、数据量和文本信息的互补性。

Conclusion: 提出了多模态预测的实用指南，明确了文本信息何时有效及其适用条件。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when
(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary
predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.
Our empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be
expected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和地理-共现-文本信息，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、泛化等方面存在不足，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在真实数据集和多个POI任务中验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型有效解决了POI嵌入中的挑战，提升了任务表现。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能通过记忆任务特定数据在基准测试中作弊，削弱评估的有效性。现有研究多关注检测泄漏，而忽略其影响缓解。

Method: LastingBench通过扰动识别泄漏点，并将其改写为反事实内容，破坏模型记忆同时保留评估意图。

Result: 在先进问答基准测试中，LastingBench显著减少了记忆效应，显示出性能差距。

Conclusion: LastingBench提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，确保基准测试的长期稳健性，促进更公平的模型评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码预测诊断，但ICD代码无法捕捉临床医生的丰富推理过程，导致模型临床实用性受限。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测与EHR数据生成语义丰富的查询，通过嵌入相似性检索相关CPG知识片段，并将指南内容与模型输出融合生成临床对齐的建议。

Result: 原型系统在高血压诊断中表现优异，检索精度、语义相关性和临床指南依从性均优于基于RAG的基线模型，且架构轻量适合本地化部署。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的方法，将医疗语言模型与循证临床实践结合，具有广泛临床部署潜力。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法使用通用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行时间线摘要，但存在主题相关性评估和时间线理解不足的问题，导致摘要信息不准确或包含无关内容。

Method: 提出TIM模型，采用渐进优化策略，包括指令调优和双对齐奖励学习方法，结合语义和时间视角提升摘要性能。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出色，能够有效总结时间线。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化策略显著提升了开放领域时间线摘要的能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

Motivation: 自回归TTS模型在语音自然度上有优势，但难以精确控制时长，限制了其在需要严格音视频同步的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了IndexTTS2，支持显式指定生成token数量或自由生成模式，结合GPT潜表示增强稳定性，并通过软指令机制实现情感控制。

Result: 在零样本设置下，模型在词错误率、说话人相似度和情感保真度上优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2通过创新方法解决了自回归模型的时长控制问题，并实现了音色与情感的独立控制，提升了TTS系统的灵活性和表现。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的表现及其潜在影响。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析其政治倾向、情感和语言特征。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真评论，但更易制造共识；真实与人工评论在语义空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于操纵在线政治讨论，具有广泛的AI驱动话语操纵影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs却表现出意外的结构感知能力，这促使作者探索结构建模对语言模型的作用以及MLPs作为GNNs替代方案的潜力。

Method: 作者提出了一种模块化探测框架，通过控制模块选择性使用GNN或其解耦组件（消息传递和特征转换操作），评估各自对语言模型表征的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，MLPs作为特征转换模块能有效提升语言模型表征的语言知识，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在特征转换方面具有优势，可作为GNNs的高效替代方案，而结构建模需结合特征转换操作以实现最佳效果。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

TL;DR: 研究发现自监督语音Transformer中前馈层的特定神经元与说话者信息相关，保护这些神经元可显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督语音Transformer如何编码说话者信息，填补研究空白。

Method: 分析前馈层神经元与k-means聚类和i-vector的关联，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 这些神经元对应广泛的语音和性别类别，保护它们能显著保留说话者任务的性能。

Conclusion: 特定神经元在编码说话者信息中起关键作用，保护它们可优化模型修剪效果。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中的参数知识偏见如何影响HerO系统的自动事实核查结果，发现直接提示时模型对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，而生成的证据受提示策略显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM中的参数知识偏见对事实核查系统的影响，特别是HerO系统在FEVER-25基准中的表现。

Method: 通过两种实验：(1) 直接提示模型进行事实核查；(2) 生成支持、反驳或中立的证据文档，分析偏见对检索结果和最终判决的影响。

Result: 直接提示时，模型对50%的声明标记为“证据不足”；生成的证据受提示策略影响，50%为独特内容。模型有时拒绝为虚假声明生成支持文档，导致负面偏见。

Conclusion: 尽管证据检索受提示策略影响，最终判决预测在不同策略下表现稳定。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TLQA基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在时间相关列表问答任务中的表现，发现现有模型在时间对齐和列表构建方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在时间理解和多实体列表生成任务中表现不佳，缺乏相关基准测试。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间对齐的列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型表现。

Result: 发现当前模型在闭卷设置中难以提供完整答案和时间对齐，开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA为未来研究提供了明确方向，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

### [139] [Offensive Language Detection on Social Media Using XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21795)
*Reem Alothman,Hafida Benhidour,Said Kerrache*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于XLNet的自动检测模型，用于识别社交媒体上的攻击性语言，性能优于BERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容增加，手动审核不现实，需自动化系统。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，评估于OLID数据集，采用过采样和欠采样策略。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容上优于BERT，BERT在识别攻击目标上略优。

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习在攻击性语言检测中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

grounded tools. Built around the phenomenon of type turbulence,
allotaxonographs provide map-and-list visual comparisons of pairs of
heavy-tailed distributions. Allotaxonographs are designed to accommodate a wide
range of instruments including rank- and probability-turbulence divergences,
Jenson-Shannon divergence, and generalized entropy divergences. Here, we
describe a suite of programmatic tools for rendering allotaxonographs for
rank-turbulence divergence in Matlab, Javascript, and Python, all of which have
different use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法提升其可解释性。

Method: 通过分类基于Transformer架构（编码器、解码器、编码器-解码器）的XAI方法，并评估其解释能力与实际应用。

Result: 综述了现有XAI技术的分类、评估方法及其应用场景，为透明化LLMs提供了系统化视角。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究透明化LLMs的技术挑战与资源，以推动负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引起的语义和语用变化，而非简单的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率出现显著变化，但具体结构尚不明确，研究旨在揭示这些变化是语义、语用还是纯粹词汇层面的。

Method: 通过PubMed科学摘要的频率趋势分析，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组和词汇变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明变化主要是语义和语用的；同时观察到某些词汇（如“important”）使用频率下降。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型对语言的影响主要是语义和语用的，而非单纯词汇替换，这有助于理解语言技术如何塑造人类语言。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性为计算作者归属带来挑战，需结合深度表示和领域特征以提高准确性。

Method: 采用多输入神经网络框架，包括基于Transformer的语言编码器，结合Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，使用647,653节诗句进行验证。

Result: 加权投票准确率为71%，高置信度阈值（0.9）下准确率达97%，但覆盖率较低。

Conclusion: 该方法在波斯诗歌作者归属中表现优异，为风格分析、作者争议和多语言研究提供了潜力。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

Motivation: 深度学习在NLP中表现优异，但其黑盒性质和计算效率问题引发了可解释性和效率的担忧。

Method: 提出LinguaSynth框架，整合五种语言特征类型（词汇、句法、实体级、词级语义和文档级语义），使用透明逻辑回归模型。

Result: 在20 Newsgroups数据集上达到84.89%的准确率，超越TF-IDF基线3.32%，句法和实体级特征对消歧至关重要。

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释、资源高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，证明深度神经网络并非高性能文本分类的必要条件。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Result: 在8个基准数据集和3个任务上的实验表明，生成一致性假设普遍成立，提出的方法优于基线。

Conclusion: 生成一致性假设具有实际价值，可用于改进LLM的置信度估计。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Method: 提出Derivational Probing方法，分析BERT模型中词嵌入在不同层传播时微观和宏观句法结构的构建。

Conclusion: 句法结构的构建是自底向上的过程，且宏观结构的整合时机对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

TL;DR: DeepTalk提出了一种基于Mixture of Experts架构的自适应模态专家学习框架，解决了原生多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因数据不足导致的性能下降问题，性能损失仅为5.5%，对话延迟低于0.5秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原生MLLMs在保留丰富的副语言特征（如情感和韵律）的同时，因配对语音-文本数据不足导致性能下降和灾难性遗忘。

Method: DeepTalk通过MoE架构自适应区分模态专家，进行单模态训练后联合多模态协作训练。

Result: DeepTalk性能损失仅5.5%，显著低于原生MLLMs的20%以上，对话延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在性能损失和延迟方面表现优异，提供了流畅的语音交互体验。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

Conclusion: 该基准为语音模型开发和评估提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

Motivation: 评估VLMs作为通用世界模型的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白。

Method: 提出两阶段框架（感知与预测），并引入WM-ABench基准进行大规模实验。

Result: 实验显示VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现不佳，如运动轨迹区分接近随机准确率。

Conclusion: VLMs与人类水平的世界建模能力存在显著差距。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用训练过程中的检查点模型作为数据信号源，通过其影响力优化数据混合，显著提升了预训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据混合是一个难题。检查点模型在训练过程中展现出不同的能力，但通常未被充分利用。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在基准测试中的能力，利用其一阶影响力近似对源数据进行数据混合优化。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了预训练性能，最高提升达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力，为模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性问题，发现其在工具调用过程中容易出错，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，增大模型规模并不能显著提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估主要关注端到端工具使用，而忽略了稳定性，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段（如读取文档、选择工具、生成参数和处理响应）的脆弱性。

Result: 代理在每个阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱，增大模型规模无显著改善且可能增加攻击风险。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在角色扮演中表现出的偏见行为，尤其是作为移民检查员时的决策模式。

Method: 使用ERG理论构建人类需求层次，设计短篇叙事让LLMs决定是否批准入境。

Result: 分析六种LLMs显示其决策存在统计显著模式，部分模型对边缘化身份拒绝率更高。

Conclusion: LLMs在决策中隐含偏好，且对身份线索和需求层次反应不一，数据已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种混合方法（GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame），结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，显著提高了对预训练语言模型的越狱成功率，并突破了现有防御系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击。现有方法各有局限性，需要更有效的攻击手段以揭示模型弱点。

Method: 提出两种混合攻击方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级技术，评估其在Vicuna和Llama模型上的表现。

Result: GCG + PAIR在Llama-3上的攻击成功率（ASR）达91.6%，显著高于PAIR的58.4%；GCG + WordGame在严格评估下仍保持80%以上的ASR，且能突破高级防御系统。

Conclusion: 混合攻击方法暴露了当前安全防护的漏洞，强调了对抗性攻击的全面防御需求。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在通用领域表现优异，但在驾驶舱等特定领域（涉及专业词汇和多语言对话）表现不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 收集驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，手动标注数据，提出多种规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: WER从68.49%（未微调未规范化）降至26.26%（微调并规范化）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了驾驶舱对话转录的准确性，验证了微调和规范化方案的有效性。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Motivation: 由于现有研究对LLMs是否能替代人类进行实证研究存在争议，需要更深入地理解实验设计的差异。

Result: 研究发现，社交模拟应通过其拟合场景中的实证真实性进行验证。

Conclusion: 论文主张在基于生成代理的社会模拟中应更加严谨。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

Result: 发现仅需少量组件即可实现基础任务的高性能，但复杂任务需要更多组件支持。

Conclusion: GPT-2 Small中主谓一致功能由特定子网络实现，其复杂度随任务难度增加而提升。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

Motivation: 比较机器翻译与人工翻译在儿童文学翻译中的表现，探索机器翻译在风格特征上的潜力。

Method: 构建包含21种翻译的《彼得潘》语料库，使用通用和特定特征集（共447个特征），通过机器学习的分类和聚类技术进行分析。

Result: 在通用特征上，HT与MT在连接词分布和1-gram-YiYang比例上有显著差异；在特定特征上，LLMs在风格特征上更接近HT。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格特征上表现优于NMTs。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Result: NMT和LLM输出均存在MTese，原中文文本与机器翻译输出区分度高；LLM词汇多样性更高，NMT更多使用括号。

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出具有独特语言特征，LLM和NMT表现不同，但中外企业开发的LLM无显著差异。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现推理成本降低70%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种高效推理策略，并引入新基准为未来LLM稳健推理研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏跨域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡查询领域表示，DAPFAM旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建数据集，包含1,247个查询家族和45,336个目标家族，使用IPC代码标注跨域关系。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and

Conclusion: RCO通过基于修正偏好的监督方案，有效提升了语言模型的批评-修正循环。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,

*Patrick Haller,Jannis Vamvas,Rico Sennrich,Lena A. Jäger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的探测任务QM，利用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，提高了基于问题的偏见评估的稳定性，并比较了指令调整模型与其基础版本的偏见差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估LLMs政治偏见时稳定性不足，导致模型间比较不可靠，需要更多上下文支持。

Method: 提出QM任务，使用人类调查数据作为上下文示例，评估指令调整模型与基础模型的偏见差异。

Result: 实验表明QM提高了评估稳定性，指令调整可能改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效利用上下文示例，偏见分数更小。

Conclusion: QM是一种有效的偏见评估方法，指令调整和模型大小对偏见有显著影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

*Albert Agisha Ntwali,Luca Rück,Martin Heckmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GPT-4o的新型方法，用于检测结构化数据集中的个人数据，通过结合上下文信息显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CASSED和Microsoft Presidio）在检测个人数据时缺乏对上下文信息的利用，导致性能受限。

Method: 利用GPT-4o，结合特征名称、值、其他特征名称及数据集描述等上下文信息进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，基于GPT-4o的方法在真实数据集（如MIMIC-Demo-Ext）和需要上下文的数据集（如Kaggle和OpenML）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要更多包含个人信息的真实数据集以推动领域发展。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM作为评估工具时存在的评分偏差问题，提出了一个框架来全面评估这种偏差，并通过实验揭示了现有评估模型的评分稳定性受偏差影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估工具（LLM-as-a-Judge）在复杂任务中表现优异，但其评分偏差影响了公平性和可靠性，目前对评分偏差的系统研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成扩展现有基准，构建评估数据集，设计多维度评价指标，全面评估评分偏差。

Result: 实验表明现有评估模型的评分稳定性受评分偏差影响，进一步探索为评分提示模板设计和偏差缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM-as-a-Judge中评分偏差的重要性，为未来设计更公平可靠的评估方法提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了随机解析策略在复杂输入和引入意外性因素后是否仍能保持高通信准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类语言理解并非随机解析，但先前研究表明随机策略可实现高通信准确性，研究者希望验证在更复杂条件下是否依然成立。

Method: 修改实验设置：(I)使用具有层次结构的复杂输入，(II)在目标函数中加入意外性相关项。

Result: 待实验验证。

Conclusion: 研究旨在揭示随机解析策略在更接近自然语言的条件下是否仍有效。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

TL;DR: QuickSilver是一个无需修改模型权重或结构的模块化框架，通过动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合等机制，显著减少推理时的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理阶段占据了大部分延迟和能耗，现有方法通常需要重新训练或架构修改，QuickSilver旨在在不改变模型的情况下优化推理效率。

Method: QuickSilver结合了动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，无需辅助网络或模型修改。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上测试，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，且困惑度几乎无增加（<=0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver为LLM推理提供了一种高效且兼容性强的优化方案，适用于冻结的密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估方法未能反映真实临床诊断的复杂性和迭代性，需要更贴近实际的评估工具。

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC病例转化为逐步诊断任务，并开发MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队进行诊断和测试选择。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%，优于普通医生和现成模型。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和策略性行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精准性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1模型通过M3CTS生成高质量空间推理监督数据，结合fDPO优化方法，显著提升了细粒度空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出M3CTS生成多样且逻辑一致的LongCoT推理轨迹，并设计fDPO方法，通过空间奖励机制优化描述性接地和逻辑推理。

Result: fDPO在空间质量和数量任务上分别提升4.1%和9.0%，SpatialReasoner-R1在SPATIALRGPT-Bench上刷新SoTA，平均准确率提升9.8%。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1结合fDPO显著提升了细粒度空间推理能力，同时在通用视觉语言任务上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中面临几何失真和循环一致性等挑战，TanDiT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TanDiT利用统一扩散模型生成切平面图像网格，并通过模型无关的后处理步骤增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化到训练数据之外，处理复杂文本提示，并生成高质量、多样化的全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT为全景图像生成提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，并引入了新的评估指标和基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，利用MLLM内部表示指导搜索最相关图像区域，显著提升细粒度VQA任务的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉问答（VQA）任务在现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中仍具挑战性，现有视觉裁剪方法存在任务特定微调需求、低效搜索或与高效注意力实现不兼容等问题。

Method: FOCUS通过四步实现：识别VQA提示中的目标对象、利用KV缓存计算对象相关性图、基于图提出并排序相关图像区域、使用排名最高的区域执行细粒度VQA任务。

Result: FOCUS在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLMs上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，并在计算效率上显著提升（减少3-6.5倍计算量）。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过高效且无需训练的方法解决了细粒度VQA任务中的视觉裁剪问题，为MLLMs的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CAST的统一模型，通过交叉注意力机制更有效地融合时空特征，提升了深度伪造视频检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限性，需要更高效的检测方法。

Method: 提出CAST模型，利用交叉注意力动态融合时空特征，增强对时间演化伪造痕迹（如闪烁的眼睛或扭曲的嘴唇）的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%。跨数据集测试AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了单任务IR的泛化能力，并在多任务统一IR中实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架可无缝集成到现有普通IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过创新设计显著提升了3D点云的语义表示能力，为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k

Motivation: 研究概率生成模型在学习全局分布时可能导致的记忆问题，而非真正的生成行为。

Method: 1. 提出MESP框架，分析VAE中潜在变量分布的重叠问题，并提出基于重叠系数的下界。2. 设计BL-AE模型，将图像编码为二进制潜在表示。3. 提出ARVM模型，输出直方图。4. 提出LCH假设，探讨局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得了竞争力的FID分数，但发现这些分数反映的是记忆而非生成。LCH假设通过实验验证了局部相关性对生成能力的重要性。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向，强调局部相关性对生成能力的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is enabling collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This approach is
particularly valuable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access
to trained medical professionals is limited. However, FL adoption in LMICs
faces significant barriers, including limited high-performance computing
resources and unreliable internet connectivity. To address these challenges, we
introduce FedNCA, a novel FL system tailored for medical image segmentation
tasks. FedNCA leverages the lightweight Med-NCA architecture, enabling training
on low-cost edge devices, such as widely available smartphones, while
minimizing communication costs. Additionally, our encryption-ready FedNCA
proves to be suitable for compromised network communication. By overcoming
infrastructural and security challenges, FedNCA paves the way for inclusive,
efficient, lightweight, and encryption-ready medical imaging solutions,
fostering equitable healthcare advancements in resource-constrained regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ImplicitQA基准，测试视频问答模型在隐含推理上的能力，填补现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答基准主要关注显性视觉内容，而忽略了隐含推理（如动机、因果关系等），无法体现人类的理解能力。

Method: 构建ImplicitQA基准，包含1K高质量QA对，覆盖多种推理维度（如空间、因果、社交等），并评估主流模型的性能。

Result: 评估显示现有模型依赖表面视觉线索，在隐含推理任务上表现不佳，性能差异显著。

Conclusion: ImplicitQA填补了视频问答领域的空白，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Conclusion: 该流程具有可重复性和可扩展性，有望用于临床早期青光眼检测。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical
utility.

Method: 评估了三种方法（监督学习、无监督学习和提示微调）在Ego-Exo4D数据集上的表现，重点关注视频摘要任务。

Result: 当前最先进模型在自我中心视频中表现不佳，而提示微调的GPT-4o表现优于专用模型。

Conclusion: 自我中心视频领域需要进一步研究，通用模型可能更适合处理其独特挑战。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

Method: 提出CAT-SG数据集，结构化标注工具-组织交互、程序变化和时序依赖；开发场景图生成模型CatSGG。

Result: CatSGG在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的临床实践（如手术培训和实时决策支持）提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Motivation: 历史地图是重要的历史资源，但其多样化的视觉表现和有限的标注数据给自动化处理带来挑战。

Method: 结合大型视觉基础模型的语义嵌入和参数高效微调，进行少样本分割。

Result: 在Siegfried数据集上，葡萄园和铁路分割的mIoU分别提升5%和13%；在ICDAR 2021数据集上，建筑块分割的PQ达到67.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在极低数据量下仍保持高性能，显著减少人工标注需求，推动历史地图的自动化处理。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the

Motivation: 现有方法通常将用户视为被动消费者，提供通用情节且个性化有限，影响了参与度和沉浸感。

Method: TaleForge包含三个模块：故事生成（LLMs根据用户提示创建叙事和角色描述）、个性化图像生成（将用户面部和服装融入角色插图）、背景生成（创建包含个性化角色的场景）。

Result: 用户研究表明，当用户作为主角出现时，参与感和归属感显著提升。用户赞赏实时预览和直观控制，但希望有更精细的叙事编辑工具。

Conclusion: TaleForge通过个性化文本和图像的结合，推动了多模态故事叙述的发展，创造了沉浸式、以用户为中心的体验。

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

TL;DR: PrefPaint通过结合人类反馈改进Stable Diffusion Inpainting，在医学图像修复中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像修复的准确性对诊断至关重要，现有模型可能生成不准确图像，需专家标注以提高可靠性。

Method: PrefPaint引入人类反馈训练Stable Diffusion Inpainting，避免昂贵奖励模型，开发了交互式Web界面。

Result: PrefPaint减少视觉不一致性，在医学领域生成更真实的息肉图像，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过人类反馈和交互界面显著提升医学图像修复的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

TL;DR: ProSAM提出了一种改进的视觉参考分割方法，通过变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，解决了现有SAM方法在边界生成提示导致的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想，常在物体边界生成提示，导致不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM采用变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: 在Pascal-5i和COCO-20i数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Conclusion: 分层多智能体框架有效提升了生成密室逃脱谜题图像的质量，为复杂图像生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We challenge text-to-image models with generating escape room puzzle images
that are visually appealing, logically solid, and intellectually stimulating.
While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance
reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this
task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning,
layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate
through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and
functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves
output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance
clarity, while maintaining visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种创新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制和混合训练策略，成功从EEG数据生成3D对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将EEG数据转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。

Method: 采用双重自注意力机制的EEG编码器，结合交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习，并利用稳定扩散和变分评分蒸馏训练神经辐射场。

Result: 成功从EEG数据生成内容和结构相似的3D对象。

Conclusion: 该方法为EEG数据到3D对象的转换提供了新思路，拓展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

Motivation: 随着多模态数据（如RGB-IR）应用的增加，存储和传输成本成倍增长，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包含LCEB和LCFB模块，用于提取和融合跨模态的低频上下文信息，以优化熵参数预测。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上表现优于现有RGB-IR和单模态压缩方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，尤其在跨数据集评估中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为rPPG任务提供了一种有效的自监督学习框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Result: 在14个下游任务中，SPADE的少样本性能显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SPADE展示了形态学和分子信息整合的潜力，为病理学任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决人脸对齐中误差偏差问题的方法，通过各向异性方向损失（ADL）和各向异性注意力模块（AAM）优化CNN模型，最终在多个数据集上取得了最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸对齐任务中，误差分布存在偏差（沿地标曲线的切线方向扩散），这种偏差与模糊的地标标注任务密切相关，但现有研究较少关注。

Method: 提出ADL（对各向异性方向施加强约束）和AAM（生成各向异性注意力掩模，放松切线方向约束），并将二者整合为ADNet进行端到端训练。

Result: 在300W、WFLW和COFW数据集上实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: ADL和AAM的互补性有效解决了误差偏差问题，提升了模型对人脸结构和纹理细节的学习能力。

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

*Boyuan Sun,Jiaxing Zhao,Xihan Wei,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的令牌压缩策略，用于视频多模态大语言模型，通过语义连通组件（SCC）实现全面的语义覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于注意力分数压缩令牌，但无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且易导致冗余。

Method: 采用SCC方法将令牌分配到不同的语义区域，提出两步时空令牌压缩策略。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor在令牌压缩方面优于其他方法，适用于视频多模态任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过稀疏标记数据集生成密集面部标记的框架，无需额外成本即可提升现有面部对齐网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集面部标记在美容医学和面部美化等场景需求高，但现有研究多关注稀疏标记。

Method: 利用稀疏标记数据集（如300W、WFLW），通过弱监督学习细化稀疏标记并适应密集标记，设计多个操作符实现。

Result: 在密集300W测试集及原始稀疏300W、WFLW测试集上均达到最优精度。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升面部对齐的标记密度和精度，且无需额外成本。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感（RS）图像理解的新型大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）框架，通过语义增强的多级对齐和语义感知专家建模，解决了现有LVLM在RS领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在自然图像领域表现优异，但由于遥感图像在视觉外观、对象尺度和语义上的显著差异，其直接应用于遥感领域效果受限。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于多级视觉特征对齐；2）语义感知专家建模，分层处理不同级别的语义表示。

Result: 在多个遥感任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）中，该框架实现了跨多语义级别的一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了通用LVLM与遥感特定需求之间的差距，展示了其在遥感视觉语言理解中的能力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Result: DPU-Former在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过创新的结构和融合策略，显著提升了光学遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts
as consultants, utilizing a diverse tool pool to comprehensively analyze
questions. Through comprehensive experiments, GeoMap-Agent achieves an overall
score of 0.811 on GeoMap-Bench, significantly outperforming 0.369 of GPT-4o.
Our work, emPowering gEologic mAp holistiC undErstanding (PEACE) with MLLMs,

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉定位中表现优异，但视觉标记剪枝会显著降低其性能。研究发现位置ID对齐问题是主要原因，提出GAP方法无需额外训练即可恢复90%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉标记剪枝虽能降低计算成本，但会严重损害模型的视觉定位能力，导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning（GAP）方法，通过调整位置ID解决剪枝后的对齐问题。

Result: GAP方法在RefCOCO验证集上将LLaVA的准确率从剪枝后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP方法简单有效，适用于多种模型和剪枝策略，无需额外资源即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测标注不一致的训练图像，提升自动化评分的鲁棒性，减少人工审核需求。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

Motivation: 随着点云数据应用增多，检测分布外（OOD）点云对象对模型安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究对此问题探索不足。

Method: 利用3D视觉语言模型（3D VLMs）进行OOD检测，提出SODA方法，通过邻域评分传播解决合成数据与真实数据间的域偏移问题。

Result: 实验表明，SODA在无需额外训练的情况下，优于现有方法，在多种数据集和问题设置中表现最佳。

Conclusion: SODA通过邻域评分传播有效解决了3D VLMs中的域偏移问题，显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格结构识别（TSR）是语义数据提取的基础，但现有方法需要改进速度和鲁棒性。

Method: SepFormer采用粗到细的两阶段方法，通过两个Transformer解码器预测表格分隔线，逐步优化单线到线带分隔线。

Result: SepFormer在多个数据集（如SciTSR、PubTabNet等）上达到25.6 FPS，性能与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: SepFormer通过创新架构和优化方法，在表格结构识别任务中实现了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Result: 有效解决了组织变形、切片伪影、染色变异和光照不一致等问题，无需重新训练或微调。

Conclusion: ZeroReg3D为3D组织学分析提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been
made publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/ZeroReg3D

Motivation: 现有方法在3D视觉定位中过于依赖3D训练数据或仅关注单一模态（空间或语义），限制了复杂场景中的应用效果。

Method: SPAZER首先从最优视角生成3D渲染，进行粗定位，再结合2D图像进行3D-2D联合决策，实现精准定位。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为AIGODIs的质量评估和优化提供了有效工具，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on
https://github.com/IntMeGroup/AIGCOIQA to facilitate future research.

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen和Potsdam数据集上的实验表明，SDRNet性能优于当前深度卷积神经网络。

Conclusion: SDRNet通过多上下文特征学习和全局-局部上下文结合，有效提升了高分辨率遥感图像的语义分割性能。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

Result: 在ScanObjectNN、ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart等数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了点云理解任务的性能，解决了随机掩码的局限性。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

TL;DR: 提出TASeg框架，结合文本信息改进RGB-T语义分割，解决视觉特征相似性和模态异构问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-T分割模型依赖低层视觉特征，缺乏高层文本信息，难以区分视觉相似类别；SAM与热图像和文本的整合存在模态异构和计算效率问题。

Method: 使用LoRA微调技术适配视觉基础模型，提出动态特征融合模块（DFFM）融合多模态视觉特征，并引入CLIP文本嵌入提升语义对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集上验证，TASeg在挑战性场景中表现优异，且参数更少。

Conclusion: TASeg通过文本感知和多模态融合，显著提升了RGB-T语义分割的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉单目标跟踪方法R1-Track，通过GRPO强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL，在GOT-10k基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，结合规则奖励函数，开发了R1-Track模型。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准上表现突出，支持通过边界框或文本描述灵活初始化。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

Method: 作者提出指数扭矩剪枝（ETP），采用指数力应用方案对神经网络模块进行正则化，有效剪除冗余和远距离模块，保留必要模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，ETP在多种领域均能实现比现有剪枝策略更高的压缩率，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的剪枝方法，显著提升了模型压缩效果。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on

Motivation: 零样本语义分割需要从已见类别的监督中分割未见类别，但现有方法在视觉语言对齐和特征粒度上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg模型，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头，并通过选择性全局蒸馏（SGD）和语义对齐模块（SAM）优化特征对齐。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了零样本语义分割中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于重建和渲染的说话头合成方法对身份特定模型的依赖问题，提高计算效率和可扩展性。

Method: 结合全局高斯场（支持多身份共享表示）和通用运动场（捕捉跨身份的共同运动动态），实现快速身份适应。

Result: 实验表明，FIAG在质量和通用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIAG框架通过共享结构和运动先验，显著提升了说话头合成的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过强制直线约束提高左心室测量准确性的新框架，结合解剖M模式和B模式图像，减少了人工标记的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标记左心室测量点耗时且易出错，现有深度学习方法常导致标记点错位，影响测量准确性。

Method: 训练一个基于解剖M模式图像的标记点检测器，实时从B模式视频中计算并转换回B模式空间，结合半自动设计，用户仅需放置虚拟扫描线。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比标准B模式方法更准确，且适用于不同网络架构。

Conclusion: 该框架通过半自动设计和直线约束，显著提高了左心室测量的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Result: 在EMTD Benchmark上，MirrorMe在保真度、唇同步准确性和时间稳定性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过创新设计实现了实时、高保真的音频驱动肖像动画，解决了现有方法的延迟和时间一致性问题。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的方法，通过滚动快门相机中单条扫描线的线投影交点估计相对位姿，无需显式建模相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决滚动快门相机在结构从运动（SfM）中的位姿估计问题，避免复杂的运动建模。

Method: 利用线投影与单条扫描线的交点进行位姿估计，支持单视图或多视图场景，并开发了最小求解器处理平行线和已知重力方向的情况。

Result: 在Fastec数据集上的实验验证了方法的可行性，为滚动快门SfM的初始化提供了潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为滚动快门SfM提供了一个无需运动模型的基础模块，具有进一步开发的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器在非语言推理任务（如视觉感知、医学诊断）中的局限性，模仿人类双系统认知过程。

Result: 在视觉任务和医学图像癌症定位中，性能优于大规模监督学习、基础模型甚至人类专家。

Conclusion: 该范式为非语言机器推理提供了变革性潜力，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Motivation: 现有远程心率测量方法通常忽略超短视频片段的需求，而本文旨在填补这一空白，专注于从2秒视频中准确测量心率。

Method: 提出周期性引导的rPPG估计方法，确保超短片段信号与长片段信号的周期性一致；引入生成器重构长rPPG信号以减少频谱泄漏。

Result: 在四个rPPG基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅准确测量超短视频的心率，还优于现有技术，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了超短视频片段中心率测量的挑战，为远程心率监测提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: TPM改进ADNet，通过绑定原型位置和多原型扩展，提升医学图像少样本分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADNet在背景建模和适应性方面存在不足，TPM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Tied Prototype Model (TPM)，绑定原型位置，支持多原型和多类分割，并利用类先验优化自适应阈值。

Result: TPM显著提升了分割准确性。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新视角。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Conclusion: 自动化管道重建方法显著提高了数字孪生建模的速度和准确性，同时降低成本。

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

Result: 在多维数据恢复任务（如图像修复、去噪和点云上采样）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CP-INR在连续数据表示中具有理论保证和实际优势，为张量分解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Q-Frame通过高效帧选择和多分辨率缩放，显著提升了视频-LLM的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在视觉推理中的绑定问题，即感知特征与视觉指称物之间的关联不可靠。

Method: 在视觉输入中引入低层次空间结构（如水平线），并结合鼓励序列化、空间感知解析的文本提示。

Result: 在视觉搜索、计数、场景描述和空间关系任务中，性能显著提升（如GPT-4o视觉搜索准确率提高25.00%）。

Conclusion: 低层次视觉结构是提升视觉语言模型性能的有效策略，优于纯文本方法。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Conclusion: RetFiner通过视觉语言优化显著提升了基础模型的性能，为OCT图像分析提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于耦合特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦特征空间和优化策略，有效提升了Few-shot目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

Conclusion: FS-VAE显著提升零样本动作识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视图约束显著提升了配准性能，适用于术中导航。

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强中的两个主要挑战：不同条件下的图像差异大，以及增强效果受主观偏好和用户意图影响。

Method: 在傅里叶频域中结合深度强化学习，引入零参考图像评估策略进行训练，推理阶段采用基于零频率分量的个性化自适应迭代策略。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的感知质量和个性化适配性。

Conclusion: ReF-LLE通过创新方法有效解决了低光照图像增强的挑战，为个性化需求提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合4D信息和优化采样策略，有效提升机器人预训练模型的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Method: 提出EAMamba框架，引入多向扫描模块（MHSSM）和全方位扫描策略，优化计算效率和全局信息捕捉。

Result: 实验表明，EAMamba在多种修复任务中FLOPs降低31-89%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAMamba有效解决了Vision Mamba的局限性，为图像修复任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a
significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance
compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否像人类一样依赖场景上下文进行对象识别和引用。

Method: 引入COOCO数据集，测试VLMs在不同场景-对象一致性和噪声水平下的表现，并进行注意力分析。

Result: 模型会根据场景-对象语义相关性和噪声水平动态调整对上下文的依赖，并在中等噪声下更关注目标对象。

Conclusion: VLMs能动态平衡局部和上下文信息进行对象引用生成，相关数据和模型已开源。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法依赖文本条件，但跨模态不对齐（因果、语义、空间）削弱了其效果。

Method: 提出VisionDrop，基于视觉内注意力进行令牌选择，并设计渐进式剪枝流程，保留细粒度信息。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，无需额外训练或复杂修改。

Conclusion: VisionDrop简单有效，支持高效推理并保持任务性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段优化和冲突感知策略，有效解决了3D室内场景生成的挑战，适用于多种输入模态。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新的架构和损失设计，显著提升了视频外绘的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著改善了图像匹配和视觉定位性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨检测器特征匹配的挑战，提升了实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision

unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

(VLMs) for effective OOD detection in 3D point clouds. By constructing a graph
based on class prototypes and testing data, we exploit the data manifold
structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt
clustering and self-training negative prompting to improve OOD scoring with
VLM. Our method is also adaptable to few-shot scenarios, providing options for
practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across synthetic and real-world datasets 3D point
cloud OOD detection.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Conclusion: 为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Conclusion: Shape-for-Motion为高质量可控视频编辑提供了关键解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

TL;DR: WarpRF是一个无需训练、通用的框架，用于量化辐射场的不确定性，通过反向变形和一致性测量实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定框架，缺乏通用的不确定性量化工具。WarpRF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用反向变形将可靠渲染投影到新视角，测量与渲染图像的一致性。

Result: WarpRF在不确定性量化和下游任务（如主动视图选择）中表现优异。

Conclusion: WarpRF简单、高效且通用，适用于任何辐射场实现。

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.
