ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess\nToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a\nnovel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in\nreaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present\nTomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting\nand responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of\nTomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,\nfew-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,\nchain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and\ninformation about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized\nboth variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,\nGPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,\nwe conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided\nparticipants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed\nintent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM\ncapabilities of Tomcat and our study participants.

The\ncompositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional\ngeneralisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training\ndistribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data\ndistribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the\nmodel works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the\nprocesses through which these components are combined. We present these notions\nin a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a\nseries of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.\n  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of\nmodels can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit\nbased models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from\none of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of\ncompositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the\nproductivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the\nsystematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation\ntasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the\nTrain data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model\non one of the trained models.

However, existing structured\nprompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,\nand often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking\ncritical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in\nmulti-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce\nCodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and\nenables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In\nCodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system\nroles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode\nenriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,\nand typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into\ncohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We\nevaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,\nHotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show\nconsistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36\npercentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,\nour method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,\nour approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,\nrespectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in\nthe development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems.

Plummer"], "title": "Beyond Token Pruning: Operation Pruning in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by\neliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while\nmaintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting.

In long-term planning tasks,\nhowever, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper.

However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video.

Evaluation across three\ncybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,\ndemonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP\nmodel achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,\nrespectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.\nNotably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller\ndatasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient\ndomain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous\npretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with\ncomputational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants\nin threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while\nchallenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM\nspecialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DAP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7DAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08DAP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528126\u767e\u4e07\u8bcd\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff08Llama-3.1-8B\u3001DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B\u548cLlama-3.3-70B-Instruct\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFSDP\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08CTI-MCQ\u3001CyberMetric\u548cSecEval\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.718\u30010.933\u548c0.864\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4e86LLM\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5bf9\u5927\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

However, despite their strong\nperformance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly\nregarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles.

However, traditional approaches rely\non human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often\noverlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other\nmulti-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory\nSynergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language\nmodels as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and\nphenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of\nconcept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --\nspanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which\nspontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,\nself-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical\ncorrelations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for\nphenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the\nheart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging\nphenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional\nconfounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on\ndiagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve\nperformance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences\nas small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks.

We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the\nquestion of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment\ncontext, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying\nboth present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical\nadvances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u533a\u5206\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e2d\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u53d7\u963b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e8c\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u5224\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u4e8b\u524d\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\uff09\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\uff08\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5316\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8f6f\u6a21\u578b\u7684AI\u76d1\u7763\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a\nlightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),\nwhich transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex\nteacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher\nmodel follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its\nlatent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency\ntrends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).\nHowever, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in\nslow training and high memory usage.

However, automated data quality control faces\nunique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed\ndirectly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndata quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the\ntraining dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have\nsimilar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data\nquality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the\nprivate data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner\nproducts as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality\ncontrol evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous\ndomain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected\nby our method can often outperform other data selection methods for\ncollaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in\nmedical, multilingual and financial settings.

However, current methods\npredominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,\nfailing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.\nFurthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a\nsingle reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse\ndemands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic\nmethods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as\nthere is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural\nnetworks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and\nspecific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified\nneurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first\nintroduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query\nentity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching\nposterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is\nproposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as\nwell as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node.

The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question.

While\ncomputational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease\ndetection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and\nbiases in existing label sources.

To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,\ntransformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels\nwith a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from\nEHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the\nscope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning\nembeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence\npatterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level\nrepresentations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare\npulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from\nBoston Children's Hospital.

These geometric corrections\nlead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural\nnetworks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees\nrecover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve\nsubstantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional\nmanifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the\ntightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential\nvolume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved\nspaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework\nprovides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning\ncapacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep\nlearning on structured data domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b0\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u975e\u6b27\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u622a\u9762\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u534a\u5f84\u7b49\u6d41\u5f62\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f2f\u66f2\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u7684Rademacher\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u7d27\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In this\narticle, we further detail the key elements of the demonstration, and also\nprovide an overview of the experimental design that is being currently used in\nthe DARPA Science of Artificial Intelligence and Learning for Open-World\nNovelty (SAIL-ON) program to evaluate external teams developing\nnovelty-adaptive gameplaying agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNOME\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8ba8\u8bbaAI\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347AI\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bbAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0cGNOME\u5e73\u53f0\u652f\u6301\u672a\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Web GUI\u8fdb\u884c\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "result": "GNOME\u5728NeurIPS 2020\u4e0a\u4ee5Monopoly\u6e38\u620f\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u88ab\u7528\u4e8eDARPA SAIL-ON\u8ba1\u5212\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "GNOME\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76AI\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency.

This can\nerode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable\ndetectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising\ncues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the\ninherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose\nLATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the\nevolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling\nthe trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE\ncaptures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated\nimages. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature\nrefinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it\nis fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight\nclassifier.

Existing research commonly attributes\nhallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter\nmeans the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user\nexpectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or\nexternally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that\nhallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human\npsychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing\nVLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,\nand a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically\nanalyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals\npsychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,\nwe investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size\ninfluence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated\nquestions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit\nstronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting\nincreasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human\nsubject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural\ndifferences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new\nperspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the\nimportance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The\nbenchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5AIpsych\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u503e\u5411\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0cVLMs\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8fce\u5408\u503e\u5411\u4f46\u6743\u5a01\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\u6216\u8fce\u5408\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u504f\u89c1\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8fce\u5408\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6743\u5a01\u504f\u89c1\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1AIpsych\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u4f1a\u589e\u5f3a\u8fce\u5408\u503e\u5411\u4f46\u51cf\u5c11\u6743\u5a01\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86VLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3VLMs\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal\norder as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can\nquantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing\nwhat recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while\nkeeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to\ndesign a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the\nmodel's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute\ntimestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our\ncounterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively\nenhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were\ninteracted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between\nitems).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCETRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCETRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u79bb\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "CETRec\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u7edd\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CETRec\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u5728\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Our EBM focuses\non the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2\n(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline\nImager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.\nMulti-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train\nthe EBM model.

We further enrich and debias these signals\nthrough lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random\ntrace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter\nPreference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,\nenabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly\non these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on\nQwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate\nthat ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,\nTB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF\npresents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs\nthrough autonomous reward modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u8ddf\u968f\uff08ARF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5668\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u914d\u5668\u504f\u597d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u548cTB\u5fae\u8c03\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u5668\uff0870%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u968f\u673a\u622a\u65ad\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u504f\u597d\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7TB\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u504f\u597d\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\uff0cARF\u6bd4PPO\u548cDPO\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.3%\u548c7.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "ARF\u4e3aRLHF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Prior studies of LLM reliability have\nprimarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while\nmathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of\nunsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in\nmathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both\nsolvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which\nincorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems\nsynthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.\nExperiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.\nLLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate\nfabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a\nreliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable\nproblems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of\nsolvable problems.

Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician\nreview. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because\n1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often\nunavailable in real-world settings. While the \"LM-as-judge\" paradigm (a LM\nevaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss\nsubtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we\npropose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to\ntrain evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are\nfactually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or\nreference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a\ndataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a\nphysician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6\ndiverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,\nproprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly\nimproves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,\nincreasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety\nclassification scores up to 86%.

The effect of regional consistency on\nclassification information learning and the rational use of dual-frequency data\nare two main difficulties for dual-frequency collaborative classification. To\ntackle these problems, a selected knowledge distillation network with\nstatistical-based sample rectification (SKDNet-SSR) is proposed in this\narticle. First, in addition to applying CNN and ViT as local and global feature\nextractors, a statistical-based dynamic sample rectification (SDSR) module is\ndesigned to avoid the impact of poor regional consistency on spatial\ninformation learning process. Specifically, based on the fact that the PolSAR\ncovariance matrix conforms to the complex Wishart distribution, SDSR first\ndynamically evaluates the sample purity, and then performs pixel selection and\npixel generation to remove noisy pixels, thereby avoiding the feature\ninteraction between informative pixels and noisy pixels and improving the\nclassification feature extraction process. Next, a dual-frequency gate-selected\ndistillation (DGSD) module is constructed to emphasize the advantages of\ndifferent frequency bands and perform complementary learning on dual-frequency\ndata. It uses the dominant single-frequency branch on each sample as teacher\nmodel to train the dual-frequency student model, enabling the student model to\nlearn the optimal results and realizing complementary utilization of\ndual-frequency data on different terrain objects.

This cycle-consistent formulation\nintegrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,\nenforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and\nrecognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the\nframework of the \\emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which\nposits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with\nhigh-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,\nsupports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial\ncompositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to\nclassical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as\nintentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised\nlearning in a unified probabilistic framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine (C\u00b2HM)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Helmholtz Machine\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Helmholtz Machine\uff08HM\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "C\u00b2HM\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u524d\u5411\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9006\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u611f\u5b98\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "C\u00b2HM\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u5408\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u5faa\u73af\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "C\u00b2HM\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In\nthis work, we introduce MolVision, a novel approach that leverages\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) by integrating both molecular structure as images\nand textual descriptions to enhance property prediction.

To better capture three\ndomain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary\nambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy.\nFurthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to\nimprove its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations\non ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed\nCPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art\napproaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative\nparadigms for surgical phase recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCPKD\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u539f\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u6076\u6027\u80bf\u7624\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u9ecf\u819c\u4e0b\u5265\u79bb\u672f\uff08ESD\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCPKD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u539f\u7406\u9010\u6b65\u91cd\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u6355\u6349\u9886\u57df\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728ESD820\u3001Cholec80\u53ca\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCPKD\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0cCPKD\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger\nsets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant\nunlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)\nor large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions\nfrom those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can\nlead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework\nwith an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize\nunlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets\ndemonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves\nthe performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and\n(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD\nimages leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS\noutperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,\nrespectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance.

Although existing DG techniques, such as data manipulation, learning\nstrategies, and representation learning, have shown significant progress, they\npredominantly address single-modal data. With the emergence of numerous\nmulti-modal datasets and increasing demand for multi-modal tasks, a key\nchallenge in Multi-modal Domain Generalization (MMDG) has emerged: enabling\nmodels trained on multi-modal sources to generalize to unseen target\ndistributions within the same modality set. Due to the inherent differences\nbetween modalities, directly transferring methods from single-modal DG to MMDG\ntypically yields sub-optimal results. These methods often exhibit randomness\nduring generalization due to the invisibility of target domains and fail to\nconsider inter-modal consistency. Applying these methods independently to each\nmodality in the MMDG setting before combining them can lead to divergent\ngeneralization directions across different modalities, resulting in degraded\ngeneralization capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages Unified Representations to map different paired\nmodalities together, effectively adapting DG methods to MMDG by enabling\nsynchronized multi-modal improvements within the unified space.

We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language\nC+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes.

It is typically applied\nwhen access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world\nscenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,\nsuch as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising\nsolution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),\nwhich enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target\ndomain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address\ndomain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality\nof prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.\nIn the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to\nimprove the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In\nthe second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach\nto enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations.

The model achieved strong\nperformance for identifying well-documented categories such as living\ncondition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score\n> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or\nhighly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical\nactivity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at\nleast one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our\nerror analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation\ninconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced\ngeneralizability due to the model being trained on social history sections\nonly. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the\ncompleteness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Flan-T5-Large\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6cd5\u8bed\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d613\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff08SDoH\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4f1a\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff08SDoH\uff09\u5bf9\u5065\u5eb7\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u4e2d\u5e38\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347SDoH\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Flan-T5-Large\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6cd5\u56fd\u5357\u7279\u5927\u5b66\u533b\u9662\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u53f2\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522bSDoH\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u5c45\u4f4f\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u5a5a\u59fb\u72b6\u51b5\u7b49\uff09\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570>0.80\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa95.8%\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u79cdSDoH\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316EHR\u6570\u636e\u76842.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "NLP\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u975e\u82f1\u8bedEHR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dSDoH\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication\nbottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware\ncommunication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them\nacross GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales\nzeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory\nefficiency while substantially improving training throughput.

To address these limitations, we propose MRC-DETR, a novel and\nefficient detection framework tailored for bare PCB defect inspection, built\nupon the foundation of RT-DETR. Firstly, to enhance feature representation\ncapability, we design a Multi-Residual Directional Coupled Block (MRDCB). This\nmodule improves channel-wise feature interaction through a multi-residual\nstructure. Moreover, a cross-spatial learning strategy is integrated to capture\nfine-grained pixel-level relationships, further enriching the representational\npower of the extracted features. Secondly, to reduce computational redundancy\ncaused by inefficient cross-layer information fusion, we introduce an Adaptive\nScreening Pyramid Network (ASPN). This component dynamically filters and\naggregates salient low-level features, selectively fusing them with high-level\nsemantic features. By focusing on informative regions and suppressing redundant\ncomputations, ASPN significantly improves both efficiency and detection\naccuracy. Finally, to tackle the issue of insufficient training data,\nparticularly in the context of bare PCBs, we construct a new, high-quality\ndataset that fills a critical gap in current public resources.

In this setting, an LLM\nagent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant\ninformation from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper\nexplores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected\nnumber of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy\nalgorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information\ngain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate\nestimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very\ndifficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which\nleads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better\nestimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information\nPursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on\nconformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship\nbetween prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate\nuncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets.

Previous work has mainly\nrelied on text-level supervision to bridge the gap between observed states and\nunobserved actions, but it struggles with capturing intricate temporal\nrelationships among actions. Building on these efforts, we propose the Masked\nTemporal Interpolation Diffusion (MTID) model that introduces a latent space\ntemporal interpolation module within the diffusion model. This module leverages\na learnable interpolation matrix to generate intermediate latent features,\nthereby augmenting visual supervision with richer mid-state details. By\nintegrating this enriched supervision into the model, we enable end-to-end\ntraining tailored to task-specific requirements, significantly enhancing the\nmodel's capacity to predict temporally coherent action sequences. Additionally,\nwe introduce an action-aware mask projection mechanism to restrict the action\ngeneration space, combined with a task-adaptive masked proximity loss to\nprioritize more accurate reasoning results close to the given start and end\nstates over those in intermediate steps. Simultaneously, it filters out\ntask-irrelevant action predictions, leading to contextually aware action\nsequences.

To remedy this problem,\nwe attempt to delve into some underlying common characteristics among various\nattacks for generality. In this work, we reveal the commonly overlooked low\nentropy prior (LE) implied in various adversarial samples, and shed light on\nthe universal robustness against unseen attacks in inference phase. LE prior is\nelaborated as two properties across various attacks as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig.\n2: 1) low entropy misclassification for adversarial samples and 2) lower\nentropy prediction for higher attack intensity. This phenomenon stands in stark\ncontrast to the naturally distributed samples. The LE prior can instruct\nexisting test-time defense methods, thus we propose a two-stage REAL approach:\nRectify Adversarial sample based on LE prior for test-time adversarial\nrectification. Specifically, to align adversarial samples more closely with\nclean samples, we propose to first rectify adversarial samples misclassified\nwith low entropy by reverse maximizing prediction entropy, thereby eliminating\ntheir adversarial nature.

The\ninterpretation of LiDAR and camera data achieves exceptional results but\ntypically requires to accumulate and process temporal sequences of data in\norder to extract motion information. In contrast, radar sensors, which are\nalready installed in most recent vehicles, can overcome this limitation as they\ndirectly provide the Doppler velocity of the detections and, hence incorporate\ninstantaneous motion information within a single measurement. % In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of moving object segmentation in noisy radar point\nclouds. We also consider differentiating parked from moving cars, to enhance\nscene understanding. Instead of exploiting temporal dependencies to identify\nmoving objects, we develop a novel transformer-based approach to perform\nsingle-scan moving object segmentation in sparse radar scans accurately. The\nkey to our Radar Velocity Transformer is to incorporate the valuable velocity\ninformation throughout each module of the network, thereby enabling the precise\nsegmentation of moving and non-moving objects. Additionally, we propose a\ntransformer-based upsampling, which enhances the performance by adaptively\ncombining information and overcoming the limitation of interpolation of sparse\npoint clouds. Finally, we create a new radar moving object segmentation\nbenchmark based on the RadarScenes dataset and compare our approach to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce\niteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the\npipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for\noptimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent\nLLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select\nschemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary\nprompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian\nrisk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without\nrequiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's\nsuccess rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and\nemploys posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,\nenabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection.

We demonstrate that StructSense\ncan overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of\ncross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse\nneuroscience information extraction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "StructSense\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u7531\u6587\u672c\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5408\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "StructSense\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\u5b98\u5f62\u6210\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u53c2\u4e0e\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "StructSense\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "StructSense\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple\nscore-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model\nimproved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused\nwith BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B\ndataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset.

While current Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform\nfast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,\nwe enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed\nadjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses\ntwo key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to\nadjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the\nsteering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'\nrepresentation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation\nediting-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based\nscaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty\nestimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity.

However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model.

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at\nelevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,\nsupplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D\nobject-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift\nintroduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we\nemploy a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as\nparallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar\nposition, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which\nis unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of\nreal-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate\ngeneralizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather\nscenarios absent from the training set.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance.

To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel\n(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a\ncontinuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the\niterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant\ncalculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness.

This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the\nexpected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,\nbypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further\nreduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture\nintricate structural patterns in graphs.

In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials\n(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the\nkey innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting\nto Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized\nDiffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By\ncoupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing\nvelocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space.

Here, we introduce the\nPEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal\ndifferential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from\nchaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This\napproach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization\nlandscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process\nwithout distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by\nrecovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from\nnoise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of\nthe dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is\ncorrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that\nthis method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct\nsymbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount\nof data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method\nderives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as\nnetwork sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing\nyet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving\nmicroscale neuronal parameters.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks\n(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their\nextension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,\nthe challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled\nphysical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions.

These\nfindings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a\npost-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for\nthe distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the\nkey property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce\na conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from\nCoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable.

However, existing models typically produce\nonly short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and\nreal-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing\nStreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on\nflow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with\ndifferent partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content\nconsistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with\nvarying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,\nwe train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a\nmultistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is\nperformed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,\nthe total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of\nchunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance\nat 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution.

The retrieved context enables\nthe LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final\nanswer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG\noffers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs.

We inspect four classes of prompting\nstrategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and\nevaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For\neach prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a\nfrontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models\n(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language\nmodels fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone\naccounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning\nyields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and\nnarrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional\nexperiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance\nin 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical\nreasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and\nLoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware\nevaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs.

Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay\ncalculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates.

As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe\nhaze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely\nfrom visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers\ncritical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing\nmethods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in\nvisible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared\nsemantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant\nscenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on\nrecovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary\ncues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of\ndual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and\nrich texture details.

However, most existing DG-based works have merely focused on\nmodeling statistical dependence between sensor data and activity labels,\nneglecting the importance of intrinsic casual mechanism. Intuitively, every\nsensor input can be viewed as a mixture of causal (category-aware) and\nnon-causal factors (domain-specific), where only the former affects activity\nclassification judgment. In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them.

Additionally, various tasks in human animation, such as\nlip-syncing, audio-driven full-body animation, and video generation from start\nand end frames, often require different specialized models. The introduction of\nlarge video models has not alleviated this dilemma. This raises an important\nquestion: Can we make human animation Faster, Higher in quality, Stronger in\ngeneralization, and make various tasks Together in one model? To address this,\nwe dive into video generation models and discover that the devil lies in the\ndetails: Inspired by MAE, we propose a novel unified Multi-Task paradigm for\nhuman animation, treating diverse generation tasks as spatial-temporal local\nreconstructions, requiring modifications only on the input side; Given the\ninterplay and division among multi-modal conditions including text, image, and\naudio, we introduce a multi-modal decoupled cross-attention module to fuse\nmulti-modals in a divide-and-conquer manner; We propose a new SFT+Reward\nalternating training paradigm, enabling the minimal model with 1.3B parameters\nto achieve generation quality comparable to models with 10 times the parameters\ncount.

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter\nmodels from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-\nand long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We\nfurther propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \\rat with local\nattention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local\ninteractions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces\ncache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances\nperformance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense\nreasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase\nin a summarization SFT task.

Existing low-light enhancement methods often\nstruggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to\nconsider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art\nmethods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative\nsolutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color\ndistortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework\n(RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting\nconditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an\nilluminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a\nspecialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition\nfield establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light\nconditions.

However, the bias terms associated with\nthese boundaries remain misaligned, leading to inconsistent classification\nthresholds and degraded performance on unseen target domains. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel DGFAS framework that jointly aligns weights and\nbiases through Feature Orthogonal Decomposition (FOD) and Group-wise Scaling\nRisk Minimization (GS-RM).

The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using\nmixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process\nof machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient\nconditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches\nusually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors\nto construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of\ndescriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,\nthe learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A\nlack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred\nchemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great\nimportance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising\nmachine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,\nand many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction\nproblem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to\nthe traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors.

However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined\neffects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different\nlocations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data\noften consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and\noccupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these\nvariables or require a separate model for each.

To address this, we introduce the\nMulti-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built\non the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles\nmultivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The\nproposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and\nseparates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions\ninto two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike\nprior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across\nall traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises\nin practice.

These results\nhighlight the significant potential of controllable multimodal agents in\ntransforming static textual materials into dynamic, effective, and accessible\npresentation formats.

To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT\nframework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently\ncompresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token\npruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the\ncross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand\nthe student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through\nparameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through\nextensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only\n1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.\nThis ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple\nscenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements\nin real-world applications.

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nmulti-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to\naddress the above challenges.

Despite significant\nadvancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains\n(source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains\n(target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain\ngeneralization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose\ndeep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection\non various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly\nfocusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial\nto achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For\nsome domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis\nrelying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in\neach modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this\nfusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of\nmisinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization\nmodel via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation\ndetection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We\ninvolve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a\nshared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal\nlearning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core\nfeatures of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through\ncross-modal guided denoising.

However, directly\nrendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions\n(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to\nfind model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then\nminimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this\nbilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.\nIn this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation\nmethods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the\nHessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a\ncomprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that\nrelies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM\nutilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and\nefficient data assessment.

While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning.

The quadratic\ncomputational complexity relative to window size restricts its ability to use a\nlarge window size for expanding the receptive field while maintaining low\ncomputational costs. To address this challenge, we propose PromptSR, a novel\nprompt-empowered lightweight image SR method. The core component is the\nproposed cascade prompting block (CPB), which enhances global information\naccess and local refinement via three cascaded prompting layers: a global\nanchor prompting layer (GAPL) and two local prompting layers (LPLs). The GAPL\nleverages downscaled features as anchors to construct low-dimensional anchor\nprompts (APs) through cross-scale attention, significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. These APs, with enhanced global perception, are then used\nto provide global prompts, efficiently facilitating long-range token\nconnections. The two LPLs subsequently combine category-based self-attention\nand window-based self-attention to refine the representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. They leverage attention maps from the GAPL as additional\nglobal prompts, enabling them to perceive features globally at different\ngranularities for adaptive local refinement.

Its common\nsolution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a\nsubstitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers\nare trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted\nteachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This\nhinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit\nDFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,\ninspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness\non OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups\naccording to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and\nused for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as\nOOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge.

Traditional\nmethods often grapple with the high cost of meticulously curated paired\nimage-text datasets and struggle with precise control over fine-grained visual\nattributes and intricate spatial relationships. Our Hi-SSLVLM addresses these\nlimitations through a unique two-stage self-supervised learning strategy.

The\nsecond stage, Self-Refinement and Guided Image Generation, leverages this\nacquired knowledge by an Internal Compositional Planning (ICP) mechanism, where\nthe LVLM first formulates detailed textual sub-prompts to guide the image\ngeneration process, complemented by a novel Semantic Consistency Loss for\nprecise output alignment.

Since the scene is changing over time, different generated views need\nto be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. While previous works learn\nsuch consistency by training from multiple views, the generated scene regions\nare bounded to be close to the training views with limited camera movements. To\naddress this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager that reformulates the dynamic\nscene generation as a scene outpainting process for new dynamic content. As 2D\noutpainting models can hardly generate 3D consistent motions from only 2D\npixels at a single view, we consider pixels as rays to enrich the pixel input\nwith the ray context, so that the 3D motion consistency can be learned from the\nray information. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to\na dynamic point cloud with the estimated video depths. Then we render the\npartial video at a novel view and outpaint the video with ray contexts from the\npoint cloud to generate 3D consistent motions. We employ the outpainted video\nto update the point cloud, which is used for scene outpainting from future\nnovel views.

The\ndominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational\n\"meaning vectors.\" This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer\nmodels where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not\nfrom data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,\nprecomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,\nsemantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent\ntext, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with\ntrainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to\n\"representational interference\" in conventional models, where the embedding\nlayer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features.

Building upon these achievements, diffusion\nmodels have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,\nsuper-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from\ndegraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained\ndiffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,\nthese methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising\nprocess. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),\na strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing\nfrom an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising\nsteps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce\ninconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts\nthe weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate\npotential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ\nacross multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring,\nand compressed sensing.

While vector and graph\nembeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art\npipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for\ngiven full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to\nclassifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which\nfail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and\ninconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two\nclasses. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to\naddress this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order\nLogic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations\nthrough Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of\nthis approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,\ninconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the\nlimitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets\nannotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of\nthese approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical\nconnectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning.

This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

We find this simple guidance during\npost-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse\nmodel families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream\ntasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find\nthat steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on\ngenerating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on\nsimple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and').

Various heterogeneous FL\n(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among\nthem, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only\nshares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL\napproaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their\ndiscriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel\nPBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:\nPrototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU).

Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual\nand textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and\nclinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.\nSpecifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the\nconventional practices in medical image analysis.

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration.

The main challenge of HRL is efficient\ndiscovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this\nstructure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the\nsubgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to\nlearn it.

The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector.

However, existing methods are limited to\nchallenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information\nand lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic,\nspatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose\nDreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge\nforecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a\nperception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically,\nDreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction,\nintegrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet\ncomprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how\nhumans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning\nchains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and\nsemantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured\nattention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information\nleakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to\nmodel the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a\ndiffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from\nshared latent features.

CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a\nsingle diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate\npredictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides\nthe generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic\nconditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a\ncondition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and\nsemantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff\nsignificantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial\naccuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation\nparadigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoT-Diff\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u5e03\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e03\u5c40\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8131\u8282\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "CoT-Diff\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b03D\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5e03\u5c40\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoT-Diff\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7a7a\u95f4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad834.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "CoT-Diff\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

This issue underscores the importance of visual localization\ntechniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes\nU-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to\naddress these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using\nhigh-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first\nextracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View\n(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input.

However,\nboth lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,\nlimiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,\nour work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture\ngeneration, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially\ngrounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing\ntwo-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized\nmotion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.\nOur framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic\ndata generation and situated evaluation.

The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it.

Diffusion models (DMs) have\nshown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)\nsettings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address\nthis issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key\ntypes of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype\ninformation $\\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and\n($ii$) contextual information $\\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class\nvariability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables\ncorresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.\nObserving that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose\nmaximizing $\\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \\beta \\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling\nprocess, where $\\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing\n$\\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop\nvariational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a\ndata-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling\n(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset\ndistillation across all IPC settings.

Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically\nbrief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural\nlanguage are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the\nexpensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task\nof explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the\nunderlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and\ntime. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available\ndatasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the\nproblem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of\ndescriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while\nstate-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating\nshorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos\nand text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and\nlanguage is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared\nrepresentation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space\nand time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to\nintegrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural\nlanguage description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and\nexplainable video description generation process can function as a fully\nautomatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student\npathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system.

Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their\nreliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of\ndiscriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language\n(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as\na promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely\nunexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL).

UGG-ReID is designed to mitigate noise\ninterference and facilitate effective multi-modal fusion by estimating both\nlocal and sample-level aleatoric uncertainty and explicitly modeling their\ndependencies. Specifically, we first propose the Gaussian patch-graph\nrepresentation model that leverages uncertainty to quantify fine-grained local\ncues and capture their structural relationships. This process boosts the\nexpressiveness of modal-specific information, ensuring that the generated\nembeddings are both more informative and robust. Subsequently, we design an\nuncertainty-guided mixture of experts strategy that dynamically routes samples\nto experts exhibiting low uncertainty. This strategy effectively suppresses\nnoise-induced instability, leading to enhanced robustness. Meanwhile, we design\nan uncertainty-guided routing to strengthen the multi-modal interaction,\nimproving the performance. UGG-ReID is comprehensively evaluated on five\nrepresentative multi-modal object ReID datasets, encompassing diverse spectral\nmodalities. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves\nexcellent performance on all datasets and is significantly better than current\nmethods in terms of noise immunity.

Unlike previous methods, we cast shadow\nremoval as diffusion-based inpainting. To this end, we first train a\nshadow-independent structure extraction network on a real-world portrait\ndataset with various synthetic lighting conditions, which allows to generate a\nshadow-independent structure map including facial details while excluding the\nunwanted shadow boundaries. The structure map is then used as condition to\ntrain a structure-guided inpainting diffusion model for removing shadows in a\ngenerative manner. Finally, to restore the fine-scale details (e.g., eyelashes,\nmoles and spots) that may not be captured by the structure map, we take the\ngradients inside the shadow regions as guidance and train a detail restoration\ndiffusion model to refine the shadow removal result. Extensive experiments on\nthe benchmark datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing\nmethods, and is effective to avoid previously common issues such as facial\nidentity tampering, shadow residual, color distortion, structure blurring, and\nloss of details.

In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

Our findings of standard\nvision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even\nthough the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior.

We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the\ndeep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),\nin which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel\npruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and\npseudo-labelled samples from the target domain.

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.

This tutorial is\nmeant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,\nour focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test\ncases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the\nliterature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that\nallows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation\nwhile lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in\npractice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Kronecker\u5206\u89e3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u66f2\u7387\uff08KFAC\uff09\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "KFAC\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9bKFAC\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86KFAC\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5357\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86KFAC\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Compared to\nexisting human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key\nfeatures: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,\nranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion\nrecognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship\nprediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model\ncapabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,\nfill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with\ndiverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model\nperformance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct\nvisual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene\nvariations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term\n(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic\nanalysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual\nlengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "HV-MMBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u5355\u4e00\u3002HV-MMBench\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8986\u76d650\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "HV-MMBench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790MLLM\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "HV-MMBench\u4e3aMLLM\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Different tools are\nused for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency\nseverity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the\nmost urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework\nfor utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at\nEDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the\nelectronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for\nthree years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms\nis that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these\nparameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper\nproposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The\nmetaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive\nsimulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed\nalgorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB.

Despite\nexisting studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the\nissue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These\nspurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in\nthe textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases,\nand (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in\nvideo content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with\nincorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual\nreasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and\nenhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task\nfrom a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address\nunobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or\nphrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to\nestimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is\nperformed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on\nvideo features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows\nus to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video\nfrom the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.

Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on\nvision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.\nThis study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both\ntraining and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate\nCVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily\nadapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label\nframework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a\nsignificant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose\nCVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,\nbinary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with\ntextual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.\nBy adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the\nEndoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the\nResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that\nCVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,\nboosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific\ninference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment.

A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of\npartial annotations when integrating different tasks.

However, these developments also raise\nsignificant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,\ntraining data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying\nunauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the\nvulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we\nconduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our\napproach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive\nscore aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise\nclassification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score\naggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on\nthe tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is\nmore likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness\nof our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for\nLLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image\nscenarios.

In this work,\nwe systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,\nincluding post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the\nmodel for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task.
